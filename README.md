This repo contains the resources for the SLR carried out as part of PhD thesis "Integration analysis of solutions based on software as a service to implement Educational Technological Ecosystems" by Alicia García-Holgado and coordinated by Francisco J. García-Peñalvo. 

The SLR is focused on Architectures and Model Driven Engineering in Technological Ecosystems. Moreover, another SLR has carried out to identify previous reviews about technological ecosystems.

All the papers retrieved and the different steps in the SLR selection process are contained and documented in:
