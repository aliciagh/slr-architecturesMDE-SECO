"Yet another ecosystem literature review: 10+1 Research communities","M. Seppänen; S. Hyrynsalmi; K. Manikas; A. Suominen","Tampere University of Technology, Pori, Finland","2017 IEEE European Technology and Engineering Management Summit (E-TEMS)","20180101","2017","","","1","8","The field of non-biological ecosystem studies is riddled with different kind of ecosystems, connections and relations of which are rarely discussed. For example, the field of software ecosystems is influenced by both natural and business ecosystems, as studies have identified a strong inspiration from both. In this study, we survey the ecosystem literature and identify how different types of ecosystems as much as their aspects appear in a wide literature scope. Using a bibliometric approach, our study reveals a literature body of 2,271 documents published from 1990 onward. Our analysis identifies 11 distinct research communities with one of them focusing on software ecosystems. Furthermore, it also reveals that, although the different communities are rather connected with each other, the software ecosystems community appears as an outlier, with little connections to other communities. When examining the software ecosystem community, consisted of 147 publications, we identify four distinct thematic clusters. We characterize these clusters by their theoretical background and uncover lack of a prevailing theoretical theme. Thus, this study calls for a formation of a research agenda for the software ecosystem field.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3721-0; POD:978-1-5386-3722-7","10.1109/E-TEMS.2017.8244229","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8244229","Software ecosystem;bibliometric;research Agenda","Algorithm design and analysis;Business;Databases;Ecosystems;Focusing;Software;Technological innovation","information analysis;research and development;software engineering","bibliometric approach;ecosystem literature review;literature body;natural business ecosystems;nonbiological ecosystem studies;research communities;software ecosystem field;software ecosystems community;thematic clusters","","","","","","","","17-19 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Critical Success Factors of exploration and production software ecosystems","P. D. Saini; A. A. Aqrawi","Baker Hughes, RDS, Delft, Netherlands","2015 International Mediterranean Gas and Oil Conference (MedGO)","20151119","2015","","","1","4","By definition, the soul of software ecosystems is synergistic cooperation. As the oil and gas industry is perceived to be closed and conservative, this makes the software ecosystems in the industry unique and the main motivation for this paper. The literature currently available on software ecosystems does not cover the oil and gas exploration & production (E&P) industry and there has been limited research in this field. This paper investigates the most critical factors that make a software ecosystem successful in the E&P industry. The research was conducted on software ecosystems in the E&P industry. The sample of the research consisted of the platform providers, third-party developers and E&P companies. Through a literature review, a comprehensive software ecosystem strategy assessment model was identified and the factors from that model were evaluated. These factors are analyzed and discussed in the paper and presented from the perspective of various players of the ecosystem. Based on the results from the interviews, discussions and data analysis, a new Critical Success Factors model is designed. This model identifies the influencing factors (that affect the critical success factors) and the resulting factors (that exist because of the critical success factors).","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8572-2; POD:978-1-4799-8573-9","10.1109/MedGO.2015.7330320","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7330320","","Companies;Ecosystems;Industries;Interviews;Productivity;Software;Technological innovation","gas industry;petroleum industry;production engineering computing","E&P companies;E&P industry;exploration & production industry;exploration critical success factors;gas industry;oil industry;platform providers;production software ecosystems;software ecosystem strategy assessment model;third-party developers","","","","3","","","","16-18 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Adaptive 3D Virtual Learning Environments—A Review of the Literature","E. Scott; A. Soria; M. Campo","ISISTAN-UNCPBA-CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Campus Universitario, Paraje Arroyo Seco, Tandil, Buenos Aires, Argentina","IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","20170921","2017","10","3","262","276","New ways of learning have emerged in the last years by using computers in education. For instance, many Virtual Learning Environments have been widely adopted by educators, obtaining promising outcomes. Recently, these environments have evolved into more advanced ones using 3D technologies and taking into account the individual learner needs and preferences. This focus has led a shift to more personalized learning approaches, requiring that the environments adapt themselves to the learner. Then, many adaptive 3D environments have explored adaptive features to create new and enhanced learning experiences in different contexts. However, very little is known about both what factors are involved with adaptive 3D environments to achieve learning benefits and what assessment factors are present in current studies. For this reason, this review analyzes the recent publications on Adaptive 3D Virtual Learning Environments. Findings have revealed that these environments have covered factors on defining the learner's model, the instructional strategies and contents, and the adaptations mechanisms. Nearly half of the environments have addressed thorough assessments whereas the rest has not reported any evaluation at all. Moreover, when they report assessment, promising outcomes have also been shown not only in multiple domains of knowledge but also at various stages of education. These findings indicate that the field of Adaptive 3D Virtual Learning Environments is an active and ongoing area, and this study highlights several promising directions and suggestions for future research.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2016.2609910","10.13039/501100002923 - Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient¿¿ficas y T¿¿cnicas (CONICET); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7569100","3D virtual learning environments;Adaptive virtual environments;personalized virtual environments","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Context;Data models;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays","computer aided instruction;virtual reality","adaptations mechanisms;adaptive 3D virtual learning environments;instructional strategies;learner model","","","","","","","20160915","July-Sept. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we present a quality model that will allow the evaluation of those ecosystems in terms of their relevant quality characteristics such as health or activeness. To design this quality model we started by analysing the quality measures found during the execution of a systematic literature review on open source software ecosystems and, then, we classified and reorganized the set of measures in order to build a solid quality model.","","Electronic:978-9-8975-8124-3; POD:978-1-4799-7691-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7293864","Open Source Software;Quality Measures;Quality Model;Software Ecosystem","Ecosystems;ISO Standards;Maintenance engineering;Open source software;Proposals;Software measurement","","","","","","51","","","","29-31 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research question: How can an undergraduate-level course help computer science students better understand the multicultural and interdisciplinary scenarios that compose today's working environment? Situating the case: The literature review contextualizes the case as part of a broader group of literature concerned with curricular reforms that replace the traditional emphasis on memorization of fixed disciplinary knowledge with what have been called “21st Century Skills.” In addition, it builds a theoretical framework followed by the course that brings together Hofstede's Cultural Theory and Vygotsky's ideas regarding the social formation of the mind. Methodology: The researchers conducted two studies with a group of 62 students who participated in the course. The first one measured how students appropriated the concepts presented in the course and learning outcomes. The second one evaluated the students' perception of the course a year after they had enrolled in it. About the teaching case: Results show that the vast majority of students appropriate the concepts of the theoretical framework used throughout the course. In addition, most students perceive the courses' contribution to their professional lives positively-particularly regarding understanding cultural and transdisciplinary issues. A small group does not consider a course like the one proposed to be useful. Conclusions: The implication of this teaching case is that the ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences is something that can be addressed directly by a specifically designed course within a computer science curriculum (rather than exclusively being a seco- dary outcome of other courses). The limitations of the study are that it presents the authors' own teaching experience (therefore, it is not a third-party report) and that it uses pretesting and posttesting as an asessment tool for multicultural and transdisciplinary abilities. Future work would show how similar experiences could be conducted across other cultural scenarios and possible ways in which to engage the small group of students who do not consider the course useful.","0361-1434;03611434","","10.1109/TPC.2012.2237254","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461491","Communication;Hofstede;Vygotsky;culture;information technology (IT);intercultural communication;interdiscipline","Computer science education;Context awareness;Cultural differences;Education courses;Engineering education;Global communication;Human factors;Planning","","","","1","","26","","","20130213","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Software solutions are collaboratively built within a dynamic market, often requiring adaptation of software development processes. This trend has been broadly studied as Software Ecosystem (SECO) - in the mobile platform domain, named as Mobile Software Ecosystem (MSECO). In this paper, we share the results of a systematic mapping study on the MSECO field that analyzed 28 papers identified as relevant to answer our research questions. The results indicate the growing interest in this research field as well as the main software platforms and trending topics. We confirmed the three main MSECOs as Android (Google), iOS (Apple) and Windows Phone (Microsoft). We observed the more investigated area is mobile app development. Finally, we highlighted the main benefits: the attracting and supporting developers, then helping developers to learn and create content and the app store that allows selling and buying processes.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6564-2; POD:978-1-4673-6565-9","10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.121","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273679","mobile computing;software ecosystem;systematic mapping study","Companies;Ecosystems;Mobile applications;Mobile communication;Software;Systematics","Android (operating system);iOS (operating system);mobile computing;software engineering","Android;MSECO;Windows Phone;iOS;mobile app development;mobile software ecosystem;software development processes;systematic mapping","","3","","32","","","","1-5 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can contribute to minimize nontechnical barriers of software reuse in industry because it explores potential benefits from the relations among companies and stakeholders. An inhibitor is the complexity in defining value for reusable assets in a scenario where producers try to meet customers' expectations, and vice-versa. This paper presents a value-based mechanism to support component negotiation and socialization processes in a reuse repository in the SECO context as an extension of the Brechó-EcoSys environment. Social resources were integrated into the mechanism in order to aid component negotiation. An evaluation of the negotiation mechanism was performed, based on an analysis of its elements and functions against critical factors in the negotiation within a SECO, identified in a previous systematic literature review. In addition, an analysis of the social resources supporting the negotiation mechanism was performed against popular sociotechnical elements for SECOs, identified in a previous survey with experts in the field.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1633-4; POD:978-1-5090-1634-1","10.1109/CLEI.2016.7833328","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7833328","Component Repositories;Negotiation;Sociotechnical Networks;Software Ecosystems;Software Reuse;Value-based Software Engineering","Context;Documentation;Ecosystems;Software engineering;Software reusability;Stakeholders","customer services;market opportunities;software reusability","SECO;component markets;component negotiation;customer expectations;social resources;socialization process;software ecosystems context;software platforms;software reuse","","","","","","","","10-14 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
