A proper understanding of requirements is as important for SECOs as for more traditional ones. This article presents a mapping study on the issues of RE and quality aspects in SECOs. Our findings indicate that among the various phases or subtasks of RE, most of the SECO specific research has been accomplished on elicitation, analysis, and modeling. On the other hand, requirement selection, prioritization, verification, and traceability has attracted few published studies. Among the various quality attributes, most of the SECOs research has been performed on security, performance and testability. On the other hand, reliability, safety, maintainability, transparency, usability attracted few published studies. The article provides a review of the academic literature about SECO-related RE activities, modeling approaches, and quality attributes, positions the source publications in a taxonomy of issues and identifies gaps where there has been little research.

OSS influences the way organizations develop, acquire, use and commercialize software. SECOs have emerged as a paradigm to understand dynamics and heterogeneity in collaborative software development. For this reason, SECOs appear as a valid instrument to analyze OSS systems. However, there are few studies that blend both topics together. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of the art in OSS ecosystems (OSSECOs) research, specifically: (a) what the most relevant definitions related to OSSECOs are; (b) what the particularities of this type of SECO are; and (c) how the knowledge about OSSECO is represented. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping following recommended practices. We applied automatic and manual searches on different sources and used a rigorous method to elicit the keywords from the research questions and selection criteria to retrieve the final papers. As a result, 82 papers were selected and evaluated. Threats to validity were identified and mitigated whenever possible. Results: The analysis allowed us to answer the research questions. Most notably, we did the following: (a) identified 64 terms related to the OSSECO and arranged them into a taxonomy; (b) built a genealogical tree to understand the genesis of the OSSECO term from related definitions; (c) analyzed the available definitions of SECO in the context of OSS; and (d) classified the existing modelling and analysis techniques of OSSECOs. Conclusion: As a summary of the systematic mapping, we conclude that existing research on several topics related to OSSECOs is still scarce (e.g., modelling and analysis techniques, quality models, standard definitions, etc.). This situation calls for further investigation efforts on how organizations and OSS communities actually understand OSSECOs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Literature review; Open source software; OSS; OSSECO; SECO; Software ecosystem; Systematic mapping","Computer software; Ecology; Ecosystems; Groupware; Mapping; Open source software; Quality control; Software design; Software engineering; Literature reviews; OSSECO; SECO; Software ecosystems; Systematic mapping; Open systems",,,,,"318249; CCE02-2013, UN, Universidad Nacional de Colombia; TIN2013-44641-P","This work was developed between the years 2013 and 2016 and was supported by the RISCOSS project, which funded by the EC 7th Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under agreement number 318249.

It can contribute to minimize nontechnical barriers of software reuse in industry because it explores potential benefits from the relations among companies and stakeholders. An inhibitor is the complexity in defining value for reusable assets in a scenario where producers try to meet customers' expectations, and vice-versa. This paper presents a value-based mechanism to support component negotiation and socialization processes in a reuse repository in the SECO context as an extension of the Brechó-EcoSys environment. Social resources were integrated into the mechanism in order to aid component negotiation. An evaluation of the negotiation mechanism was performed, based on an analysis of its elements and functions against critical factors in the negotiation within a SECO, identified in a previous systematic literature review. In addition, an analysis of the social resources supporting the negotiation mechanism was performed against popular sociotechnical elements for SECOs, identified in a previous survey with experts in the field. © 2016 IEEE.","Component Repositories;

The governance of software ecosystems requires a careful balance of control and autonomy given to players. Orchestrators that are able to balance their own interests by bringing joint benefits for other players are likely to create healthy ecosystems. Selecting appropriate governance mechanisms is a key problem involved in the management of proprietary and open source ecosystems. This article summarizes current literature on software ecosystem governance by framing prevalent definitions, classifying governance mechanisms, and proposing a research agenda. We performed a systematic literature review of 63 primary studies. Several studies describe governance mechanisms, which were classified in three categories: value creation, coordination of players, and organizational openness and control. The number of studies indicates that the domain of software ecosystems and their governance is maturing. However, further studies are needed to address central challenges involved on the implementation of appropriate governance mechanisms that can nurture the health of ecosystems. We present a research agenda with several opportunities for researchers and practitioners to explore these issues. © Copyright 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","And systematic literature review; Governance; Health; Software ecosystems","Ecology; Health; Information systems; Open source software; Governance; Governance mechanisms; Research agenda; Software ecosystems; Systematic literature review; Technological perspective; Three categories; Value creation; Ecosystems",,,,,,,"Axelsson, J., Skoglund, M., Quality assurance in software ecosystems: A systematic literature mapping and research agenda (2016) Journal of Systems and Software, 114, pp. 69-812016; Barbosa, O.R., Santos, R.C., Alves, C., Werner, S., Jansen, A., Systematic mapping study on software ecosystems through a three-dimensional perspective (2013) Software Ecosystems: Analyzing and Managing Business Networks in the Software Industry, pp. 59-81. , UK, Edward Elgar Publishing; Bosch, J., Bosch-Sijtsema, P.M., Esao: A, holistic ecosystem-driven analysis model (2014) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Software Business. 2014; Brereton, P., Kitchenham, B., Budgen, D., Turner, M., Khalil, M., Lesson from applying the systematic literature review process within the software engineering domain (2007) Journal of Systems and Software, 80; Brhel, M., Meth, H., Maedcher, A., Exploring principles of user-centered agile software development: A literature review (2015) Information and Software Technology, 61; (2007) Cobit 4.1.

Architectural knowledge of the existing ecosystems is implicit and fragmented among online documentation. In protection of intellectual property, existing documentation hardly reveals influential business strategies that affect the ecosystem structure. Thus, other platform providers can hardly learn from the existing ecosystems in order to systematically make reasonable design decisions with respect to their business strategies to create their own ecosystems. In this paper, we identify a variability model for architectural design decisions of a store-oriented software ecosystem product line from an enterprise perspective, comprising business, application, and infrastructure views. We derive the variability model from fragmentary material of existing ecosystems and a rigorous literature review using a research method based on the design science paradigm. To show its validity, we describe real-world ecosystems from diverse domains using the variability model. This knowledge helps platform providers to develop customized ecosystems or to recreate existing designs in a systematic way. This, in turn, contributes to an increase in designer and developer productivity. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Architectural decisions; Software ecosystems; Variabilities","Application programs; Distributed computer systems; Ecology; Enterprise software; Planning; Product design; Software architecture; Software engineering; Strategic planning; Architectural decision; Architectural design decisions; Architectural knowledge; Ecosystem structure; On-line documentations; Protection of intellectual properties; Software ecosystems; Variabilities; Ecosystems",,,,,"CRC 901, DFG, California Department of Fish and Game; DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Collaborative Research Center “On-The-Fly Computing” (CRC 901).","Bosch, J., Bosch-Sijtsema, P., From integration to composition: On the impact of software product lines, global development and ecosystems (2010) J.

We conduct a systematic literature study, based on the most extensive literature review in the field up to date, with two primarily aims: (a) to provide an updated overview of the field and (b) to document evolution in the field. In total, we analyze 231 papers from 2007 until 2014 and provide an overview of the research in software ecosystems. Our analysis reveals a field that is rapidly growing, both in volume and empirical focus, while becoming more mature. We identify signs of field maturity from the increase in: (i) the number of journal articles, (ii) the empirical models within the last two years, and (iii) the number of ecosystems studied. However, we note that the field is far from mature and identify a set of challenges that are preventing the field from evolving. We propose means for future research and the community to address them. Finally, our analysis shapes the view of the field having evolved outside the existing definitions of software ecosystems and thus propose the update of the definition of software ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, research in software ecosystems, although the activity of over 10 years, is still characterized as premature with significant lack of software ecosystem specific theories that are solid, mature, generic, and detailed enough to be measurable and transferable. In this study, we intent to come closer to an evolution of the field by supporting the ""localization"" of research, i.e. the focus on specific types of software ecosystems. To do so, we investigate the literature of empirical, non open source ecosystem studies and intent to identify the various aspects and perspectives studied. In total, we review 56 empirical studies that investigate 55 software ecosystems. Our analysis confirms the assumption that proprietary software ecosystem studies lack deeper investigation of technical and collaborative aspects. Moreover, we identify an increased focus on organizational aspects and a rather limited focus on business. Furthermore, we identify common technology as the component investigated most in the ecosystems, both from the technical aspects, but also as means of applying orchestration. Finally, comparing the main areas with the overall ecosystem literature, we identify that empirical studies lack representation of health, motivation, actor activity, reusability, integration, and quality of ecosystems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Empirical study review; Literature review; Proprietary software ecosystems; Software ecosystems","Ecology; Open source software; Reusability; Software design; Empirical literature; Empirical studies; Literature reviews; Open sources; Organizational aspects; Proprietary software; Software ecosystems; Technical aspects; Ecosystems",,,,,,,"Manikas, K., Hansen, K.M., Reviewing the health of software ecosystems-a conceptual framework proposal (2013) Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Software Ecosystems, 987, pp. 33-44. , Alves, C.F., Hanssen, G.K., Bosch, J., Jansen, S.

However, understanding internal and external actors, resources and relationships that could be leveraged in a SECO is critical for their strategic decisions. The consequence of mistakes may be costly failures that can force an organization to move out of a market. This paper describes a systematic mapping study that targets description of software ecosystems. Our conjecture is that adequate description support leads to modeling, which will improve information and in turn strategic decisions. The survey searches existing literature for description techniques and their application for comprehensive description. The study identifies and maps 63 primary studies out of 937 candidates according to their degree of modeling support and several other important aspects for SECO description. The analysis indicates that no approach fully supports comprehensive SECO descriptions, supporting domain specific and view specific modeling of ecosystem concerns. The analysis is used to highlight areas for a future research agenda. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Domain specific; Mapping study; Software ecosystems; View","Commerce; Ecology; Mapping; Surveys; Domain specific; Mapping studies; Research agenda; Software ecosystems; Strategic decisions; Systematic mapping studies; Value proposition; View; Ecosystems",,,,,,,"Messerschmitt, D.G., Szyperski, C., (2005) Software Ecosystem: Understanding an Indispensable Technology and Industry, , The MIT Press, Cambridge, Number 0262633310 in MIT Press Books; Johnson, M.W., Christensen, C.M., Kagermann, H., Reinventing your business model (2008) Harvard Bus.

As the oil and gas industry is perceived to be closed and conservative, this makes the software ecosystems in the industry unique and the main motivation for this paper. The literature currently available on software ecosystems does not cover the oil and gas exploration & production (E&P) industry and there has been limited research in this field. This paper investigates the most critical factors that make a software ecosystem successful in the E&P industry. The research was conducted on software ecosystems in the E&P industry. The sample of the research consisted of the platform providers, third-party developers and E&P companies. Through a literature review, a comprehensive software ecosystem strategy assessment model was identified and the factors from that model were evaluated. These factors are analyzed and discussed in the paper and presented from the perspective of various players of the ecosystem. Based on the results from the interviews, discussions and data analysis, a new Critical Success Factors model is designed. This model identifies the influencing factors (that affect the critical success factors) and the resulting factors (that exist because of the critical success factors). © 2015 IEEE.",,"Ecology; Gas industry; Petroleum prospecting; Assessment models; Critical factors; Critical success factor; Exploration and productions; Literature reviews; Oil and gas exploration; Oil and Gas Industry; Software ecosystems; Ecosystems",,,,,,,"Van Den Berk, I., Luinenburg, L., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Software ecosystems: A software ecosystem strategy assessment model (2010) Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems, , Copenhagen, Denmark; Dayal Saini, P., (2014) Critical Success Factors of the Oil and Gas Software Ecosystems, , master thesis, Executive MBA Department, Stockholm School of Economics, Riga; (2015) ConocoPhillip's GeoCraft, , http://www.oilit.com/2journal/2article/0805_10.htm, the Oil IT journal Web site, May 2008, Retrieved Mar 16",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st Mediterranean Gas and Oil International Conference, MedGO 2015","16 April 2015 through 18 April 2015",,118231,,9781479985722,,,"English","Mediterr.

Software solutions are collaboratively built within a dynamic market, often requiring adaptation of software development processes. This trend has been broadly studied as Software Ecosystem (SECO)-in the mobile platform domain, named as Mobile Software Ecosystem (MSECO). In this paper, we share the results of a systematic mapping study on the MSECO field that analyzed 28 papers identified as relevant to answer our research questions. The results indicate the growing interest in this research field as well as the main software platforms and trending topics. We confirmed the three main MSECOs as Android (Google), iOS (Apple) and Windows Phone (Microsoft). We observed the more investigated area is mobile app development. Finally, we highlighted the main benefits: the attracting and supporting developers, then helping developers to learn and create content and the app store that allows selling and buying processes. © 2015 IEEE.","Mobile computing; Software ecosystem; Systematic mapping study","Computer software; Ecology; Ecosystems; Mapping; Mobile computing; Software design; Software engineering; Mobile applications; Research questions; Software development process; Software ecosystems; Software industry; Software platforms; Software solution; Systematic mapping studies; Application programs",,,,,,,"Miao, Z., Yuan, B., Discussion on pervasive computing paradigm (2005) TENCON 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference, pp. 1-6. , Nov; Henrique, D., Oliveira, D., Miranda, L.C., Esteves, E., Miranda, C., Fernandes, L., Prototipação de interfaces de aplicativos para dispositivos móveis estado da arte e desafios de IHC (2012) IHC '12 Proceedings of the 11th Brazilian Symposium on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 5138, pp. 315-324; Chesbrough, H., Open innovation the new imperative for creating and profiting from technology xerox PARC the achievements and limits of closed innovation (2003) Harvard Business School Press, pp. 1-10; Jansen, S., Cusumano, M.A., Defining software ecosystems : A survey of software platforms and business network governance (2012) Proceedings of the International Workshop on Software Ecosystems 2012, pp. 41-58; Santos, R., Werner, C., Barbosa, O., Alves, C., Software ecosystems trends and impacts on software engineering (2012) 26th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering, pp. 206-210. , Sep; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) SPLC '09 Proceedings of the 13th International Software Product Line Conference, pp. 111-119. , Splc; Cusumano, M.A., Platforms and services: Understanding the resurgence of apple (2010) Communications ACM, 53, pp. 22-24; Barbosa, O., Alves, C., (2011) A Systematic Mapping Study on Software Ecosystems, pp. 15-26; Manikas, K., Hansen, K.M., Software ecosystems-A systematic literature review (2013) Journal of Systems and Software, 86 (5), pp. 1294-1306. , May; Hansen, K.M., (2012) Software Ecosystems; Dhungana, D., Groher, I., Schludermann, E., Biffl, S., Software ecosystems vs natural ecosystems learning from the ingenious mind of nature (2010) Proceedings of the Fourth European Conference on Software Architecture: Companion Volume, pp. 96-102; Moore, J.F., (1996) The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems; Briscoe, G., De Wilde, P., Digital ecosystems evolving service-oriented architectures (2006) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Bio Inspired Models of Network, Information and Computing Systems, p. 17; Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Finkelstein, A., (2009) Business Network Management As A Survival Strategy : A Tale of Two Software Ecosystems, (2), pp. 34-48; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems (2009) 31st International Conference on Software Engineering-Companion, pp. 187-190; Dittrich, Y., Software engineering beyond the project-Sustaining software ecosystems (2014) Information and Software Technology, 56 (11), pp. 1436-1456. , Mar; Lin, F.L.F., Ye, W.Y.W., Operating system battle in the ecosystem of smartphone industry (2009) International Symposium on Information Engineering and Electronic Commerce; Taylor, R.N., The role of architectural styles in successful software ecosystems (2013) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 2-4; Berger, T., Pfeiffer, R.-H., Tartler, R., Dienst, S., Czarnecki, K., Wa Sowski, A., She, S., Variability mechanisms in software ecosystems (2014) Information and Software Technology, 56 (11), pp. 1520-1535; Fontão, A., Bonifácio, B., Dias-Neto, A., Bezerra, A., Santos, R., MSECO skill construção de competências de desenvolvedores em ecossistemas de software móvel (2014) CIBSE 2014: Proceedings of the 17th Ibero-American Conference Software Engineering, pp. 81-94. , (In Portuguese); Hyrynsalmi, S., Seppänen, M., Suominen, A., Sources of value in application ecosystems (2014) J.

In this paper we present a quality model that will allow the evaluation of those ecosystems in terms of their relevant quality characteristics such as health or activeness. To design this quality model we started by analysing the quality measures found during the execution of a systematic literature review on open source software ecosystems and, then, we classified and reorganized the set of measures in order to build a solid quality model. Finally, we test the suitability of the constructed quality model using the GNOME ecosystem. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Open source software; Quality measures; Quality model; Software ecosystem","Computer software; Ecology; Ecosystems; Open systems; Quality assurance; Software engineering; Exponential growth; Quality characteristic; Quality measures; Quality modeling; Software ecosystems; Systematic literature review; Open source software",,,,,,,"Jansen, S., Cusumano, M., Defining Software Ecosystems: A Survey of Software Platforms and Business Network Governance, pp. 13-28; Lungu, M., Malnati, J., Lanza, M., Visualizing gnome with the small project observatory (2009) Proceedings of the 6Th MSR, IEEE, pp. 103-106; (2001) Quality Model, , ISO/IEC 9126: Product quality - Part 1; Wieringa, R., Design science as nested problem solving (2009) Proceedings of the 4Th International Conference on Design Science Research in Information Systems and Technology, pp. 8:1–8:12. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; (2014) Systems and Software Engineering - Systems and Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (Square), , ISO/IEC 25000, Guide to SQuaRE; Soto, M., Ciolkowski, M., The QualOSS open source assessment model measuring performance of open source communities (2009) Proceedings of the 3Rd ESEM, pp. 498-501; Hartigh, E., Visscher, W., Tol, M., Salas, A.J., Measuring the Health of a Business Ecosystem, pp. 221-245; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., (2004) Keystones and Dominators: Framing Operating and Technology Strategy in a Business Ecosystem, , Technical report, Harvard Business School; Mens, T., Goeminne, M., Analysing the evolution of social aspects of open source software ecosystems (2011) Proceedings of the 3Rd IWSECO, pp. 1-14; Neu, S., Lanza, M., Hattori, L., D’Ambros, M., Telling stories about GNOME with complicity (2011) Proceedings of the 6Th VISSOFT, pp. 1-8; Kilamo, T., Hammouda, I., Mikkonen, T., Aaltonen, T., From proprietary to open source - growing an open source ecosystem (2012) J.

In this paper, we address what scientific literature actually means with the concept of ‘ecosystem health’ by selecting relevant articles with systematic literature review. Based on the final set of 38 papers, we found that despite a common base, the term has been used to depict a wide range of hoped characteristics of a software ecosystem. However, the number of studies addressing the topic is shown to grow while empirical studies are still rare. Thus, further studies should aim to standardize the terminology and concepts in order to create a common base for future work. Further work is needed also to develop early indicators that warn and guides companies on problems with their ecosystems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Business ecosystem; Ecosystem health; Software ecosystem; Systematic literature study","Ecology; Health; Business ecosystem; Early indicators; Ecosystem health; Empirical studies; Literature studies; Scientific literature; Software ecosystems; Systematic literature review; Ecosystems",,,,,,,"Moore, J.F., Predators and prey: A new ecology of competition (1993) Harvard Business Review, 71 (3), pp. 75-86; Moore, J.F., (1996) The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems.

The primary research goal is to develop a research agenda based on the topics identified within the research publications on the topic. The agenda is based on a systematic mapping study of 260 publications obtained from digital libraries and is influenced by a set of areas of interest, i.e., product lines, open source, third party, business models, open innovation, and strategy. The results from the study include analysis of the type of research conducted in the field, its origin and research contribution. The study identifies the need for more solutions to specific open innovation problems such as mapping business models to technical platforms; defining open ecosystem processes that foster open innovation; and improving how ecosystem players can leverage on tool support for open innovation. A direction for future research is also provided. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Embedded systems; Open innovation; Software ecosystems","Digital libraries; Ecology; Ecosystems; Embedded systems; Innovation; Mapping; Open source software; Software engineering; Business models; Ecosystem process; Open innovation; Research agenda; Research goals; Software ecosystems; Systematic mapping studies; Third parties; Open systems",,,,,,,"Messerschmitt, D.G., Szyperski, C., (2003) Software Ecosystem: Understanding an Indispensable Technology and Industry, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Axelsson, J., Papatheocharous, E., Ersson, J., Characteristics of Software Ecosystems for Federated Embedded Systems: A Case Study (2014) Inform.

In this paper we present a quality model that will allow the evaluation of those ecosystems in terms of their relevant quality characteristics such as health or activeness. To design this quality model we started by analysing the quality measures found during the execution of a systematic literature review on open source software ecosystems and, then, we classified and reorganized the set of measures in order to build a solid quality model.","Open source software; Quality measures; Quality model; Software ecosystem","Application programs; Ecosystems; Open systems; Quality assurance; Exponential growth; Quality characteristic; Quality measures; Quality modeling; Software ecosystems; Systematic literature review; Open source software",,,,,,,"Agerfalk, P.J., Fitzgerald, B., Outsourcing to an unknown workforce: Exploring opensourcing as a global sourcing strategy (2008) Mis Quartely, 32 (2), pp. 385-409; Anderson, J.C., Narus, J.A., Narayandas, D., (2009) Business Market Management: Understanding, Creating, and Delivering Value, , 3rd Edition.

Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are used to assess whether and how well such objectives are met and what the platform owner can do to improve. This paper gives an overview of existing research on KPI-based SECO assessment using a systematic mapping of research publications. The study identified 34 relevant publications for which KPI research and KPI practice were extracted and mapped. It describes the strengths and gaps of the research published so far, and describes what KPI are measured, analyzed, and used for decision-making from the researcher's point of view. For the researcher, the maps thus capture stateof- knowledge and can be used to plan further research. For practitioners, the generated map points to studies that describe how to use KPI for managing of a SECO. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Digital ecosystem; KPI; Performance indicator; Software ecosystem; Success factor; Systematic mapping","Benchmarking; Mapping; Research; Digital ecosystem; KPI; Performance indicators; Software ecosystems; Success factors; Systematic mapping; Ecosystems",,,,,,,"Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems (2009) International Conference on Software Engineering.

We illustrate our argument by a case study on design and development of a Dippler ecosystem. First, the framework for identifying the generations of TEL systems is described and expectations towards next generation of TEL systems are drawn from the literature review. After that, the dialectics of ongoing mainstream discourse (LMS vs PLE) is analysed and platform for reaching the synthesis is drawn. As we argue, the next-generation TEL systems are better understood if not referred as ""learning environments"", but rather as Digital Learning Ecosystems. Finally, process and results of a design-based research on Digital Learning Ecosystem called Dippler is described and discussed. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.","design-based research; digital learning ecosystem; learning environment; socio-technical transition","Design and Development; Design-based research; Digital learning ecosystems; Learning environments; Literature reviews; Socio-technical transitions; Technology enhanced learning; Computer aided instruction; Conceptual design; Ecosystems; Engineering education; Research; E-learning",,,,,,,"Schumpeter, J.A., (1939) Business Cycles: A Theoretical, Historical and Statistical Analysis of the Capitalist Process, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Christensen, C.M., (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Harvard Business Review Press, Cambridge; Ansari, S., Garud, R., Inter-generational transitions in socio-technical systems: The case of mobile communications (2009) Research Policy, 38 (2), pp. 382-392; Scholz, T., (2008) Market Ideology and the Myths of Web 2.0, , First Monday 13(3); Rajagopal, K., Joosten-ten Brinke, D., van Bruggen, J., Sloep, P., (2012) Understanding personal learning networks: Their structure, content and the networking skills needed to optimally use them, , First Monday 17(1); Casquero, O., Portillo, J., Ovelar, R., Benito, M., Romo, J., iPLE Network: An integrated eLearning 2.0 architecture from a university's perspective (2010) Interactive Learning Environments, 18 (3), pp. 293-308; Mott, J., Envisioning the Post-LMS Era (2010) EDUCAUSE Quarterly, 33 (1); Moodle Statistics, , http://moodle.org/stats; Weller, M., (2007) Virtual Learning Environments: Using, Choosing and Developing your VLE, , Routledge, Oxon; Paulsen, M.F., (2002) Online Education Systems: Discussion and Definition of Terms, , http://nettskolen.nki.no/forskning/Definition%20of%20Terms.pdf; Uden, L., Wangsa, I.T., Damiani, E., The future of E-learning: E-learning ecosystem (2007) IEEE Conf. on Digital Ecosystems and Technologies, pp. 113-117. , IEEE, Cairns; Geels, F.W., Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: A multilevel perspective and a case-study (2002) Research Policy, 31 (8-9), pp. 1257-1274; Genus, A., Coles, A.-M., Rethinking the multi-level perspective of technological transitions (2008) Research Policy, 37 (9), pp. 1436-1445; Buchem, I., Attwell, G., Torres, R., Understanding Personal Learning Environments: Literature review and synthesis through the Activity Theory lens (2011) Proceedings of the The PLE Conference 2011, , In, Southampton, UK, July 10-12; Design-Based Research: An Emerging Paradigm for Educational Inquiry (2003) Educational Researcher, 32 (1), pp. 5-8. , The Design-Based Research Collective; Leinonen, T., Toikkanen, T., Silvfast, K., Software as Hypothesis: Research-Based Design Methodology (2008) Proceedings of the Tenth Anniversary Conference on Participatory Design 2008, pp. 61-70. , Indiana University, Indianapolis; Väljataga, T., Pata, K., Tammets, K., Considering Students' Perspectives on Personal and Distributed Learning Environments in Course Design (2011) Web 2.0-Based E-Learning, pp. 85-107. , In: Lee, M.J.W., McLoughlin, C.

Arguably, software ecosystems are gaining importance with the advent of, e.g.; the Google Android, Apache, and Salesforce.com ecosystems. However, there exists no systematic overview of the research done on software ecosystems from a software engineering perspective. We performed a systematic literature review of software ecosystem research, analyzing 90 papers on the subject taken from a gross collection of 420. Our main conclusions are that while research on software ecosystems is increasing (a) there is little consensus on what constitutes a software ecosystem, (b) few analytical models of software ecosystems exist, and (c) little research is done in the context of real-world ecosystems.

The main aim of this research is to perform an independent literature review in order to create a classification of the typical roles named software ecosystem role classification (SERC). This research answered the research question, ""How should a classification be formulated in order to provide the base for the software ecosystem roles?"" The main result is a list of 5 major roles and 12 minor roles based on 9 papers that already discussed role identification in SECOs previously. The classification of these roles includes a description of the fundamental activities for each role. The classification enables those that model ecosystems and business models of software-related organizations to identify players quickly and their roles in ecosystems. Thereby furthering understanding of the underlying business models and value chains. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Literature review; Role classification; Software ecosystems; Software industry","Research; Societies and institutions; Software engineering; Business models; Literature reviews; Model ecosystems; Research questions; Role identification; Software ecosystems; Software industry; Value chains; Ecosystems",,,,,,,"Abdat, N., Spruit, M., Bos, M., (2010) Software as a service and the pricing strategy for vendors, pp. 154-192. , AEBR Book Series; Barbosa, O., Alves, C., A systematic mapping study on software ecosystems (2011) Proc of IWSECO, , In; Barros, A.P., Dumas, M., The rise of web service ecosystems (2006) IT Professional, 8 (5), pp. 31-37; Burkard, C., Draisbach, T., Widjaja, T., Buxmann, P., Software ecosystems: Vendor-sided characteristics of online marketplaces (2011) Informatik, , In; Hong, S., van den Goor, G., Brinkkemper, S., A formal approach to the comparison of object-oriented analysis and design methodologies (1993) Proc. of the 26th Hawaii Int'l Conf. on System Sciences, 4, pp. 689-698. , In:,.

Companies work cooperatively and competitively in order to achieve their strategic objectives. They must engage in a new perspective considering both their own business and third party ones. Inspired from properties by natural and business ecosystems, a software ecosystem covers technical and business aspects of software development as well as partnership among companies. In this paper, we undertake a systematic mapping study to present a wide review of primary studies on software ecosystems. Systematic mapping is a methodology that gives, after a systematic research process, a visual summary map of its results. The search procedure identified 1026 studies, of which 44 were identified as relevant to answer our research questions. This study mapped what is currently known about software ecosystems perspective. We conclude that software ecosystems research is concentrated in 8 main areas in which the most relevant are open source software, ecosystem modeling, and business issues. The paper is intended to practitioners and academics investigating the field of software ecosystems. It contributes to summarize the body of knowledge in the field and direct efforts for future research in software ecosystems.","Business ecosystem; Digital ecosystem; Software ecosystem; Systematic mapping study","Industry; Mapping; Research; Software engineering; Business ecosystem; Complex relationships; Digital ecosystem; Open Source Software; Software ecosystems; Strategic objectives; Systematic mapping studies; Systematic research; Ecosystems",,,,,,,"Arndt, J.M., Dibbern, J., Co-innovation in a service oriented strategic network (2006) IEEE International Conference on Services Computing; Moore, J.F., Predators and prey: A new ecology of competition (1993) Harvard Business Review, pp. 75-86. , May/June; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., Strategy as ecology (2004) Harvard Business Review, 82 (3), pp. 68-78; Petersen, K., Feldt, R., Mujtaba, S., Mattsson, M., Systematic mapping studies in software engineering (2008) 12th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering; Kitchenham, B., Procedures for performing systematic reviews (2004) Joint Technical Report, Software Engineering Group, Keele University, and Empirical Software Eng., , Nat'l ICT Australia; Budgen, D., Turner, M., Brereton, P., Kitchenham, B., Using mapping studies in software engineering (2008) Proceedings of PPIG 2008, pp. 195-204; Petticrew, M., Roberts, H., (2008) Systematic Reviews in the Social Sciences: A Practical Guide; Brereton, P., Kitchenham, B., Budgen, D., Turner, M., Khalil, M., Lessons from applying the systematic literature review process within the software engineering domain (2007) The Journal of Systems and Software, pp. 571-583; Fink, A., (2010) Conducting Research Literature Reviews: from the Internet to Paper, , Sage Publications. 3nd edition; Kitchenham, B., (2007) Guidelines for Performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, , vol 2. 3 EBSE Technical Report; Kitchenham, B., Brereton, P., Budgen, D., Turner, M., Bailey, J., Linkman, S., Systematic literature reviews in software engineering - A systematic literature review (2009) Information and Software Technology, 51 (1); Dyba, T., Dingsoyr, T., Empirical studies of agile software development: A systematic review (2008) Information and Software Technology, 50, pp. 833-859; Seaman, C.B., Qualitative methods in empirical studies of software engineering (1999) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 25 (4), pp. 557-572",,,"","CEUR-WS","3rd International Workshop on Software Ecosystems 2011, IWSECO 2011","7 June 2011 through 7 June 2011","Brussels",101600,16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890877584

As a result, identifying and evaluating the critical success factors within each of these facets is vital for the success of e-learning. This paper explores the critical success factors intertwined within the learning ecosystem namely pedagogy, technology and management of learning resources in a higher education e-learning environment. Adopting a hybrid approach consisting of a systematic literature review and interviews with experts in e-learning, this paper shows that there is a discrepancy between theory and practice in e-learning in regard to the application of pedagogies, use of technology, and management of reusable learning objects. This implies that there is a need for tackling various issues regarding the adoption of appropriate e-learning strategies, knowledge sharing, quality, granularity and reusability of learning object for sustainable e-learning. © 2008 Bhavani Sridharan, Hepu Deng and Brian Corbitt.","E-learning; Learning object; Metadata; Ontology; Reusable learning object repository","Critical success factor; E-learning environment; Higher education; Hybrid approach; Knowledge transfer; Knowledge-sharing; Learning objects; Learning resource; Reusable learning object; Systematic literature review; Theory and practice; Computer aided instruction; Computer software reusability; E-learning; Information systems; Knowledge management; Metadata; Ontology; Reusability; Engineering education",,,,,,,"Aldridge, J., Dorman, J., Fraser, B., Use of Multitrait-Mutlitmethod Modeling to Validate Actual and Preferred Forms of the Technology-Rich Outcomes-Focused Learning Environment Inventory (TROFLEI) (2004) Australian Journal of Educational and Development Psychology, 4, pp. 110-125; Alexander, S., Boud, D., Learners Still Learn from Experience When Online (2001) Teaching and Learning Online: Pedagogies for New Technologies, pp. 3-15. , in: Stephenson (ed.)
