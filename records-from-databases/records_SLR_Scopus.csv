The article places the university at the centre of the development of an innovation ecosystem to facilitate the development of ecosystem platform architectures for engaged scholarship projects and their implementation for the benefit of local communities. The platform ecosystem design framework derived in this article approaches the analysis from three levels: (1) Contextual considerations and design requirements through a development pathway framework; (2) distinguishing between top-down creation of institutional mechanisms and the emergence of bottom-up engaged scholarship activities; and (3) some reflection on the governance and orchestration of the intermediary platform architectural design considerations. © 2018 Government Technical Advisory Centre (GTAC)";"Development University; Ecosystem; engaged scholarship; innovation platform";;;;;;;;;Grobbelaar, S.S.S.email: ssgrobbelaar@sun.ac.za;;;Routledge;;;;;0376835X;;;;English;Dev.

Moreover, ICT solutions are paving innovation in every sector and therefore becoming a business factor for the success of any enterprise. The implications are manifold since technical issues need to be harmonised with social, organisational and legal aspects. In this paper we illustrate and comment the current trends to identify research directions to build services as comprehensive components accessible via APIs. The goal is to deliver services ecosystems, which call for open platforms to manage services that can connect and interact via shared protocols in dynamic heterogeneous contexts. Machine-readable semantic descriptions, microservices (single-function services), and containers (independent units of deployment) are discussed as building blocks for software architectures of the future. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.;;"Cloud computing; Semantics; Software architecture; Building blockes; Challanges; Legal aspects; Open platforms; Organisational; Semantic descriptions; Software design";;;;;;;"Banks, A., Gupta, R., MQTT version 3.1.1.

Box 14100, Aalto, Finland";The purpose of this paper is to explore the current state of data commercialisation and external distribution in the Finnish real estate and construction (REC) sector. We focus on how companies could more effectively benefit from digitalisation, with more holistic utilisation of data from smart buildings. We assess the current state of data utilisation and distribution using a start-up company analysis and industry workshops. According to our research, the data from smart buildings is gathered on a large scale but very seldom distributed outside company borders. The reason for this almost non-existent external data distribution is the lack of value of the external data. As a solution, we propose the Internet of Buildings framework. The framework is based on a platform ecosystem model that is complemented with data commercialisation roles. It takes into account the current data-related opportunities and challenges in the sector. Within the framework, we suggest stakeholder roles and modes of interaction that promote value creation from smart building data. The framework can be used as a starting point for developing data commercialisation and external data distribution in the sector. © 2017 by the authors.;"Buildings services; Data commercialisation; Data distribution; Digital technologies; Platforms; Smart buildings; Value creation";;;;;;"Tekes; 1349/31/2015";Acknowledgments: The authors thank Tekes—the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation for research funding (Grant no. 1349/31/2015).;"Iyer, B., Venkatraman, N.V., What Comes after Smart Products (2015) Harv.

In this paper the authors assess this statement and how this impacts Information and Communications Technology (ICT)'s approach to meeting the needs of the digital transformation in business and society. The demands of systems such as 1) the Internet of Things (IoT), especially sensor networks and their deployment 2) 'Industry 4.0' and its competitiveness 3) the application of intelligent technologies to the major infrastructures (big cities, ports, airports, energy grids, etc.), will not be delivered through small projects but rather will be built around complex partnerships and ecosystems. Moving from this assessment, the authors look more closely also at the means of constructing a business case for new communications solutions, noting that the Post-Information Age will create new opportunities for Network Service Providers (NSPs). In doing this, they will examine key differences in the way offerings are constructed for the whole market sector, from consumer to major corporate / central Government solutions. According to the results found, it looks as if the same techniques apply to all segments, but with different weights and different approaches to the construction of key parameters for the specific value-proposition. The authors are strongly convinced that modelling the business case, partnership options and ecosystems remain the most powerful tools in assessing digital service viability. © 2017 IEEE.;"Business Model Innovation; Digital Ecosystem Modelling; Economic Cycles; Game Theory; Landscape Theory; Post-Information Age";"Competition; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Game theory; Internet of things; Sensor networks; Business model innovation; Digital ecosystem; Economic cycles; Information age; Landscape Theory; Information services";;;;;;;"Solomou, S., Phases of economic growth (1990) 1850-1973: Kondratieff Waves and Kuznets Swings, , Cambridge University Press.

The definition, development and deployment of this type of software solutions is complex and involves several problems identified and analyzed in previous works. In order to solve these problems, an architectural pattern based on Buschmann's Layers pattern has been defined. The accumulated experience developing learning ecosystems along with the problems analysis using Business Process Model and Notation and the architectural pattern, have provided a knowledge base to define an ecosystems metamodel. The proposed metamodel provides a framework for Model-Driven Development of learning ecosystems. The main objective of the present work is to validate the ecosystems metamodel from modeling a learning ecosystem. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.;"Knowledge management; MDA; Modeling; Open Source; Software ecosystems; Software engineering; Technological ecosystems";"Computer aided instruction; Ecology; Engineering education; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Management science; Models; Open source software; Open systems; Problem solving; Software architecture; Software engineering; Architectural pattern; Business process model; Learning ecosystems; Learning environments; Model driven development; Open sources; Software ecosystems; Technological solution; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"García-Holgado, A., García-Peñalvo, F.J., Architectural pattern to improve the definition and implementation of elearning ecosystems (2016) Science of Computer Programming, 129, pp. 20-34. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2016.03.010; Alspaugh, T.A., Asuncion, H.U., Scacchi, W., The role of software licenses in open architecture ecosystems (2009) IWSECO@ ICSR.; Chen, W., Chang, E., Exploring a digital ecosystem conceptual model and its simulation prototype (2007) Industrial Electronics, 2007.

The researchers mentioned that the next generation of e-learning is e-learning ecosystem. E-learning ecosystem has many advantages, in which, learners form groups, collaborate with each other and with educators, and content designed for interaction. E-learning ecosystem faces some issues. It applies teacher-student model, in which, fixed learning pathway is considered suitable for all learners. Consequently, learners are presented with limited personalized materials. E-learning ecosystem needs to merge the personalization's concept. Semantic web ontology based personalization of learning environment plays a leading role to build smart e-learning ecosystem. This paper previews a detailed study which addresses research papers that apply ontology within learning environment. Most of these studies focus on personalizing e-learning by providing learners with suitable learning objects, ignoring the other learning process components. This paper proposes and implements framework for smart e-learning ecosystem using ontology and SWRL. A new direction is proposed. This direction fosters the creation of a separate four ontologies for the personalized full learning package which is composed of learner model and all the learning process components (learning objects, learning activities and teaching methods). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd;"E-Learning ecosystem; Learner model; Ontology; Personalization; Semantic Web Rule Language; Software architecture";"Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Ecology; Ecosystems; Ontology; Semantic Web; Software architecture; Teaching; E-learning ecosystem; Learner model; Learning Activity; Learning environments; Learning packages; Personalizations; Semantic Web ontologies; Semantic Web rule language (SWRL); Learning systems; ecosystem; human; human experiment; language; learning environment; model; motion analysis system; ontology; software; teacher; teaching";;;;;;;"Al-Azawei, A., Badii, A., State of the art of learning styles-based adaptive educational hypermedia systems (LS-BAEHSs) (2014) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology, 6 (3), pp. 1-19; Al-Yahya, M., George, R., Alfaries, A., Ontologies in e-learning: Review of the literature (2015) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, 9 (2), pp. 67-84; Alimam, M.A., Seghiouer, H., Elyusufi, Y., Building profiles based on ontology for career recommendation in E-learning context (2014) Paper presented at the multimedia computing and systems (ICMCS), 2014 international conference on; Aroyo, L., Dicheva, D., The new challenges for e-learning: The educational semantic web (2004) Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 7 (4), pp. 59-69; Azevedo, R., Aleven, V.A.W.M.M., (2013) International handbook of metacognition and learning technologies, 26. , Springer; Baldiris, S., Graf, S., Fabregat, R., Dynamic user modeling and adaptation based on learning styles for supporting semi-automatic generation of IMS learning design (2011) Paper presented at the advanced learning technologies (ICALT), 2011 11th IEEE international conference on; Baldoni, M., Baroglio, C., Henze, N., Personalization for the semantic web reasoning Web (2005), Springer; Balík, M., Jelínek, I., Improving the adaptive systems using ontologies and semantic web technologies (2007) Paper presented at the innovations in information technology, 2007.

Researchers have intensified studies in this area with the goal of assessing ecosystem health and possible causes for the success achieved. However, none of them have considered directly the effects of the software architecture on the ecosystem health. There are some architectural aspects weighting considerably on the balance of the whole ecosystem. So, software ecosystem health should be addressed based on different perspectives, aligned with novel assumptions and ways of thinking. In this paper, we exploit intersections between architecture and software ecosystem health. We consider the concept of the 'software ecosystem architectural health' from the perspective of key areas and practices, which affect the state of the ecosystem health. We also identify some research challenges and outline future work. © 2017 IEEE.;"ecosystem health; software architecture; Software Ecosystems; software practices";"Ecology; Engineering research; Health; Software architecture; Software design; Software engineering; Ecosystem health; Research challenges; Software ecosystems; Software practices; Ways of thinking; Ecosystems";;;;;-1343033, NSF, National Science Foundation;The contribution by McGregor was partially funded by the National Science Foundation grant #ACI-1343033.;"Den Hartigh, E., Tol, M., Visscher, W., The health measurement of a business ecosystem (2006) Proceedings of the ECCON 2006 Annual Meeting: ""organizations As Chaordic Panarchies"", Ser.

Decomposition of digital ecosystems into core and complementary module can potentially enable combinatorial innovation and asymmetric business models of platform providers and complementors. The layered modular architecture of digital artifacts, modularity and generativity of the ecosystem architecture help the evolutionary changes to the ecosystem through voluntaristic innovation by heterogeneous contributors which is a critical driver of ecosystem success. In this study using multi-theoretic lens of resource based view, platform architecture, strategic logic of opportunity and strategy as practice we develop a nomological network to explore the impact of platform architecture on complementor firm performance and posit a mediating role of firm's dynamic capabilities enabling competitive action. © 2017 IEEE.;"architecture; digital ecosystems; generativity; layered module architecture; modularity; platforms";"Architecture; Cloud computing; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Ecology; Network architecture; Digital ecosystem; Generativity; modularity; Module architecture; platforms; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Sandberg, J., (2014) Digital Capability-Investigating Coevolution of IT and Business Strategies, , Phd, Umeå University; Mithas, S., Tafti, A., Mitchell, W., How a firm's competitive environment and digital strategic posture influence digital business strategy (2013) Mis Quarterly, 37, pp. 511-536. , June; Svahn, F., Henfridsson, O., The dual regimes of digital innovation management (2014) System Science (HICSS), 2012 45th IEEE Hawaii International Conference, pp. 3347-3356; Yoo, Y., Boland, R.J., Jr., Lyytinen, K., Majchrzak, A., Organizing for innovation in the digitized world (2012) Organization Science, 23, pp. 1398-1408. , October; Bharadwaj, A., El Sawy, O.A., Pavlou, P.A., Venkatraman, N., Digital business strategy: Toward a next generation of insights (2013) Mis Quarterly, 37, pp. 471-482. , June; Woodard, C.J., Ramasubbu, N., Tschang, F.T., Sambamurthy, V., Design capital and design moves: The logic of digital business strategy (2012) Forthcoming, MIS Quarterly, Special Issue on Digital Business Strategy: Toward A Next Generation of Insights; Peppard, J., Galliers, R.D., Thorogood, A., Information systems strategy as practice: Micro strategy and strategizing for is (2014) The Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 23, pp. 1-10. , March; Yoo, Y., Henfridsson, O., Lyytinen, K., Research commentary-The new organizing logic of digital innovation: An agenda for information systems research (2010) Information Systems Research, 21, pp. 724-735. , November; Elaluf-Calderwood, S.M., Eaton, B.D., Sørensen, C., Yoo, Y., Control as a strategy for the development of generativity in business models for mobile platforms (2011) Intelligence in Next Generation Networks (ICIN), 2011 IEEE 15th International Conference, pp. 271-276. , October; Um, S.Y., Yoo, Y., Wattal, S., Kulathinal, R.J., Zhang, B., The architecture of generativity in a digital ecosystem (2013) International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), , December; Tiwana, A., Konsynski, B., Bush, A.A., Research commentary-platform evolution: Coevolution of platform architecture, governance, and environmental dynamics (2010) Information Systems Research, 21, pp. 675-687. , December; Eaton, B., Elaluf-Calderwood, S., Sørensen, C., Yoo, Y., Dynamic structures of control and generativity in digital ecosystem service innovation: The cases of the Apple and Google mobile app stores (2011) London School of Economics and Political Science, , April; Thomas, L.D., Autio, E., Gann, D.M., Architectural leverage: Putting platforms in context (2014) The Academy of Management Perspectives, 28, pp. 198-219. , May; Sørensen, C., De Reuver, M., Basole, R.C., Mobile platforms and ecosystems (2015) Journal of Information Technology, 30, pp. 195-197. , September; Eisenmann, T., Parker, G., Van Alstyne, M.W., Strategies for two-sided markets (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84, p. 92. , October; Gawer, A., Cusumano, M.A., How companies become platform leaders (2008) Mit Sloan Management Review, 49, p. 28; Svahn, F., (2012) Digital Product Innovation: Building Generative Capability Through Architectural Frames, , August; Majchrzak, A., Markus, L., (2012) Technology Affordances and Constraint Theory of MIS; Turber, S., Smiela, C., (2014) A Business Model Type for the Internet of Things; Baldwin, C.Y., Woodard, C.J., The architecture of platforms: A unified view (2009) Platforms, Markets and Innovation, pp. 19-44. , A.

The role of software architect is one of the main contributors to that success. Their activities are crucial for realizing the business strategy of their organization. Software ecosystems define multi-sided markets that require different strategies from a traditional two-sided market. The architectural practices in the multi-sided market must support the need for flexibility and rapid reaction. These new demands broaden our understanding of the software architect's role and the impact of their action on ecosystem structure. In particular the need to understand how to operate in a collaborative, cooperative environment to exploit competition. In this position paper, we discuss how software architect's actions influence the ecosystem health through their indicators: productivity, niche creation, and robustness. © 2017 ACM.;"Ecosystems health; Software architecture; Software ecosystems";"Commerce; Ecology; Health; Software architecture; Business strategy; Cooperative environment; Ecosystem health; Ecosystem structure; Role of software; Software architects; Software ecosystems; Two-sided markets; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"(2011) 2011 Systems and Software Engineering - Architecture Description, , ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011. 2011.

Selecting which components to use becomes a critical decision in development, but it is currently not well supported through methods and tools. This paper discusses how a decision support system for this problem could benefit from a software ecosystem approach, where participants share knowledge across organizations both through reuse of analysis models, and through partially disclosed past decision cases. We show how the ecosystem architecture becomes fundamental to deal with efficient knowledge sharing, while respecting constraints on integrity of intellectual property. A concrete architecture proposal is outlined, which is a web-based distributed system-of-systems. Experiences of a proof-of-concept implementation are also described. © 2017 IEEE.;"decision support systems; software architecture; software components; Software ecosystems; system-of-systems";"Artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Computer software reusability; Decision support systems; Ecology; Knowledge management; Software architecture; System of systems; Complex software; Concrete architecture; Decision supports; Knowledge-sharing; Software component; Software ecosystems; System components; Web-based distributed systems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Alonso, S., Herrera-Viedma, E., Chiclana, F., Herrera, F., A web based consensus support system for group decision making problems and incomplete preferences (2010) Inf.

Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life? © 2017 Association for Information Technology Trust";"digital ecosystems; digital infrastructures; digital innovation; digital platforms; research agenda";"Digital ecosystem; Digital infrastructures; Digital innovations; Digital platforms; Research agenda";;;;;;;;"Sørensen, C.; Department of Management, The London School of Economics and Political ScienceUnited Kingdom; email: c.sorensen@lse.ac.uk";;;Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.;;;;;2683962;;;;English;J.

We provide a description of a new API, known as UME::SIMD, which provides a flexible, portable, type-oriented abstraction for SIMD instruction set architectures. Requirements for such libraries are analysed based on existing, as well as proposed future solutions. A software architecture that achieves these requirements is explained, and its performance evaluated. Finally we discuss how the API fits into the existing, and future software ecosystem. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).;"Abstract interface; C++; Portability; SIMD; Vectorization";"Cesium; Computer software portability; Multicore programming; Program processors; Abstract interfaces; SIMD; SIMD instructions; Software ecosystems; Specific instruction; Vectorization; Computer architecture";;;;;;;"Apostolakis, J., Bandieremonte, M., Bitzes, G., Brun, R., Canal, P., Carminatio, F., Cosmo, G., Wenzel, S., Towards a high performance geometry library for particle-detector simulations (2015) Journal of Physics: Conference Series (Volume: 608, Number:1), , IOP Publishing; (2007) ARM Compiler Toolchain, , http://infocenter.arm.com, ARM.

This trend also affects the underlying IT architecture which has to integrate and provide software components (e.g. services) as well as hardware components (e.g. sensors) leading to a digital enterprise ecosystem. This digital ecosystem is complex so that modeling approaches which aim on simplifying complexity are eligible for their design and management. In the paper at hand, we show that existing enterprise modeling approaches are inappropriate for modeling digital enterprise ecosystems comprehensively. By using a case-based analysis we sketch extension points for a digital enterprise ecosystem modeling method based on ArchiMate. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.;"Domain-specific modeling; Enterprise ecosystem; Enterprise modeling";"Complex networks; Ecology; Digital ecosystem; Digital enterprise; Domain specific modeling; Ecosystem model; Enterprise modeling; Extension points; Hardware components; Software component; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Al-Fedaghi, S., Enterprise architecture: An alternative to archimate conceptualization (2017) Software Engineering Trends and Techniques in Intelligent Systems: Proceedings of the 6Th Computer Science On-Line Conference 2017 (CSOC2017, 3, pp. 68-77. , Silhavy, R., Silhavy, P., Prokopova, Z., Senkerik, R., Kominkova Oplatkova, Z.

Although two different institutions or companies share the same problems and goals regarding their learning and training processes, the learning ecosystems to support them are different. The components of the ecosystem, including the human factor as a key element, and the relationships between them, change over time. In other words, learning ecosystems evolve as natural ecosystems; there are many factors, both internal and external, that influence an entity. The authors have defined and developed different learning ecosystems. Moreover, they have transferred the same learning ecosystem, specifically a learning ecosystem for knowledge management in a PhD Program, to different domains.

Managing uncertainties in DSEs is challenging, and therefore, novel and solid software architecting methods, techniques and tools are needed. Our research explores the means to handle uncertainties at the software architecture level of DSEs. In this regard, we apply valuable lessons learnt from the models at runtime (M@RT) technique. This paper proposes a novel, dynamic knowledge engineering approach to handle uncertainties in DSEs at runtime using M@RT. This uncertainty handling approach aims to identify and solve two interrelated research problems: reflexivity and evolution of the ecosystem between the architecture and running system of services. Reflexivity means that the system must have knowledge of its components to make intelligent decisions based on self-awareness. In addition, we provide tool support towards automating reflexivity and evolution. Complex state machines of M@RT that serve as a dynamic knowledgebase are modeled using executable state machines, and generation of software artifacts of the model is performed at execution time. Causal connection is maintained between the runtime models and the running system. We validate and illustrate our approach using a DSE in an ambient-assisted living environment for elderly people.;"Digital ecosystems; Dynamic knowledge; Evolvability; Model-driven development; Reflexivity; Uncertainty";"Assisted living; Ecology; Education; Memory architecture; Digital ecosystem; Evolvability; Model driven development; Reflexivity; Uncertainty; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Boley, H., Chang, E., Digital ecosystems: Principles and semantics (2007) Proceedings of The International Conference on Digital EcoSystems and Technologies (DEST '07), pp. 398-403. , Cairns, Australia; Giese, H., Bencomo, N., Pasquale, L., Ramirez, A.J., Inverardi, P., Wätzoldt, S., Clarke, S., Living with uncertainty in the age of runtime models (2014) Models@Run.Time: Foundations, Applications, and Roadmaps, pp. 47-100. , N.

That could be explained by the open challenges pointed out by the Software Engineering community, as well as by the fact that many organizations adopt a more open and collaborative strategy to achieve innovation. While observing an evolution in the way platforms are used for developing applications, a specific type of SECO, which is centered on data, was identified: EcoData. It emerged in the “third model of computing platform”, recognized by industry as the confluence of new technologies such as Cloud Computing, Big Data and Analytics, Mobility and Social Business – CAMS. By reviewing the literature, non-functional requirements for EcoData applications were identified, but without a reference architecture (RA). While a RA would be useful for new solutions, the research’s goal is to provide a means for architecting and improving cross-platform SECO applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.;"CAMS; Software architecture; Software ecosystem";"Application programs; Big data; Cams; Ecology; Ecosystems; Software architecture; Software engineering; Collaborative strategies; Computing platform; Cross-platform software; Engineering community; Non-functional requirements; Reference architecture; Social business; Software ecosystems; Computer software reusability";;;;;;;"Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystem (2009) Proceedings of the 13Th International Software Product Line Conference, pp. 1-10. , San Francisco, CA, USA; Manikas, K., Hansen, K.M., Software ecosystems: A syst. literature review (2013) J.

Architectural knowledge of the existing ecosystems is implicit and fragmented among online documentation. In protection of intellectual property, existing documentation hardly reveals influential business strategies that affect the ecosystem structure. Thus, other platform providers can hardly learn from the existing ecosystems in order to systematically make reasonable design decisions with respect to their business strategies to create their own ecosystems. In this paper, we identify a variability model for architectural design decisions of a store-oriented software ecosystem product line from an enterprise perspective, comprising business, application, and infrastructure views. We derive the variability model from fragmentary material of existing ecosystems and a rigorous literature review using a research method based on the design science paradigm. To show its validity, we describe real-world ecosystems from diverse domains using the variability model. This knowledge helps platform providers to develop customized ecosystems or to recreate existing designs in a systematic way.

Their complex grown structures can be difficult to maintain and it can be hard to foresee the impact of planned and unplanned change. The PERICLES EU FP7 project developed the Digital Ecosystem Model (DEM), an ontology to model those complex DEs for supporting their maintenance and preservation. It provides concepts to express dependencies, provenance and analysis. Planned or unplanned changes to a DE represented via the DEM can be simulated in advance to analyse and mitigate risks, and to assure the quality of the DE architecture. PERICLES developed the EcoBuilder tool to support scenario experts in modelling aspects of interests of their DEs with the DEM for further investigation and maintenance. The DEM can be extended by domain specific ontologies to support various use cases of different domains, e.g. The digital media and art domains for which specialised ontologies [10] are developed in PERICLES. This approach supports documentation of the entities and their environments not only for preservation purposes, but also for the management of environmental drift in a wider range of domains, such as the digital ecosystems of Internet of Things (IoT), which we used as example in this paper.

Currently, information systems have evolved into technological ecosystems that are a set of different components related to each other through information flows in a physical environment that supports these flows, where users are part of the ecosystem. Particularly, during the last several years, the Open Source software has been used to develop these technological solutions. The aim of this paper is to formalize an architectural pattern to support the right description and implementation of eLearning ecosystems. The theoretical basis has been provided in previous works by using a comparative analysis of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats of several real case studies developed in different contexts. The problems detected through the previous analysis have been modelled using the Business Process Model and Notation. Next, the pattern has been formalized with the Service-oriented architecture Modelling Language. Finally, the pattern has been tested in a real context, namely, an institutional development for the Spanish Public Administration, which has demonstrated that the pattern works properly. As a result, we have obtained a set of Business Process Model and Notation diagrams that provide a high abstraction level for the main detected problems in eLearning ecosystems. We have also obtained an architectural pattern composed of several layers and a set of external elements that provides a solution to these problems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;"Architectural pattern; eLearning ecosystems; Information systems; Open Source software; Software engineering";"Computer software; E-learning; Ecology; Information management; Information services; Information systems; Knowledge management; Management science; Modeling languages; Open source software; Open systems; Public administration; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Software engineering; Abstraction level; Architectural pattern; Business process model; Comparative analysis; E-learning ecosystem; Institutional development; Physical environments; Technological solution; Ecosystems";;;;;;This research was performed within the University of Salamanca PhD Programme on Education in the Knowledge Society scope ( http://knowledgesociety.usal.es ).

The institutional sources of the company's platform ecosystem architecture were analyzed to explain this revolutionary change.Both an empirical analysis of a co-existing development trajectory with taxis and institutional enablers that helped to create Uber's platform ecosystem were analyzed.The analysis identified a correspondence with the ""two-faced"" nature of ICT that nurtures un-captured GDP. This two-faced nature of ICT can be attributed to a virtuous cycle of decline in prices and an increase in the number of trips.We show that this cycle can be attributed to a self-propagating function that plays a vital role in the spinoff from traditional co-evolution to new co-evolution. Furthermore, we use the three mega-trends of ICT advancement, paradigm change and a shift in people's preferences to explain the secret of Uber's system success.All these noteworthy elements seem essential to a well-functioning platform ecosystem architecture, not only in transportation but also for other business institutions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.";"ICT-driven disruptive business model; Ride-sharing revolution; Two-faced nature of ICT; Uber's system success; Un-captured GDP";"Ecology; Societies and institutions; Business modeling; Ride-sharing; System success; Two-faced nature of ICT; Un-captured GDP; Ecosystems; business development; empirical analysis; Gross Domestic Product; industrial technology; information and communication technology; software; transportation technology";;;;;"293446, Academy of Finland; SRC, Strategic Research Council";The research leading to these results has received funding from the Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland under grant agreement no: 293446 – Platform Value Now: Value capturing in the fast emerging platform ecosystems.

To ensure interoperability and the integrity of the ecosystem, it is important that candidate products are independently tested and certified against applicable interoperability requirements. Based on the experience acquired in the AAL4ALL project, we propose in this paper a model-based approach to systematize, automate and increase the assurance of such testing and certification activities. The approach encompasses the construction of several models: a feature model, an interface model, a product model, and unit and integration test models. The abstract syntax and consistency rules of these models are specified by means of metamodels written in UML and Alloy and automatically checked with Alloy Analyzer. Using the model finding capabilities of Alloy Analyzer, integration tests can be automatically generated from the remaining models, through the composition and instantiation of unit tests. Examples of concrete models from the AAL4ALL project are also presented. © 2016 IEEE.;"Ambient-Assisted Living; Certification; Integration Testing; Metamodel; Test Generation; Test Models";"Automatic test pattern generation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Integration; Integration testing; Interoperability; Testing; Verification; Ambient assisted living; Certification; Meta model; Test generations; Test models; Software testing";;;;;"FCT, Fuel Cell Technologies Program; UID/EEA/50014/2013; ERDF, European Regional Development Fund; POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006961, ERDF, European Regional Development Fund";This work is financed by the ERDF - European Regional Development Fund through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation - COMPETE 2020 Programme within project ?POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006961?, and by National Funds through the FCT - Funda??o para a Ci?ncia e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology) as part of project UID/EEA/50014/2013.;"Hill, C., Grant, R., Yeung, I., Ambient assisted living technology (2013) An Interactive Qualifying Project Report Submitted to the Faculty of Worcester Polytechnic Institute; (2015) Tcare - Conhecimento e SaÃžde SA, , http://www.tcare.pt/, (November).

In collaboration with an industrial partner, we have recognized that such applications have complex constraints on the context. We have also identified a need to model their deployment topology and functionality in order to enable their seamless integration into the platform. In this paper, we draw from research in related fields and present a model of IoT applications. It is built using semantic annotations and uses semantic reasoning to resolve context requirements. We present the implications on the architecture of the ecosystem and the concepts defined in the model. Finally, we discuss the evaluation of the model and its benefits and liabilities. Although the approach results in more complex descriptions of applications, we conclude that it is suitable for modeling applications in IoT software ecosystems since it is more adaptable and expressive than the alternatives. © 2016 IEEE.;"architecture; ecosystem; iot; model; semantic";"Application programs; Architecture; Ecology; Ecosystems; Models; Semantics; Software architecture; Topology; Complex constraints; Industrial partners; IOT applications; Model application; Seamless integration; Semantic annotations; Semantic reasoning; Software ecosystems; Internet of things";;;;;;;"Al Ali, R., Bures, T., Gerostathopoulos, I., Keznikl, J., Plasil, F., Architecture adaptation based on belief inaccuracy estimation (2014) Software Architecture (WICSA), pp. 87-90. , IEEE/IFIP Conference on, April 2014; Berger, T., Pfeiffer, R., Tartler, R., Dienst, S., Czarnecki, K., Wasowski, A., She, S., Variability mechanisms in software ecosystems (2014) Information and Software Technology, 56 (11), pp. 1520-1535; Berger, T., She, S., Lotufo, R., Wasowski, A., Czarnecki, K., Variability modeling in the real: A perspective from the operating systems domain (2010) Proc. of the IEEE/ACM Int'l Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE '10, pp. 73-82. , New York, NY, USA ACM; Capilla, R., Bosch, J., Trinidad, P., Ruiz-Cortes, A., Hinchey, M., An overview of dynamic software product line architectures and techniques: Observations from research and industry (2014) J.

The success of app stores on smartphones has also created interest for a software ecosystem that would enable external developers to create add-on applications for embedded devices. These opportunities provide the motivation for this project. The project works on challenges in introducing a software ecosystem with continuous deployment of software components to physical and software-intensive industrial products. It is based on a collaboration with an industrial partner. So far, the work has focused on modeling the variability and capabilities of software components in the ecosystem.

Tool support allows for managing architecture-guideline violations to ensure software quality. However, the decentralized development across units results in significant violation-management hurdles that must be considered. In this paper, we present a set of capabilities required to manage guideline violations within two of these large-scale software projects at Siemens. Their main purpose is process support for resolving violations, aiming to reduce the architects' and developers' effort required to handle them. Moreover, we present a prototype that implements the capabilities. © 2016 IEEE.;;"Computer software selection and evaluation; IS process; Large-scale software projects; Organizational units; Siemens; Software ecosystems; Software project; Software Quality; Tool support; Software architecture";;;;;;;"Clements, P., Northrop, L., (2002) Software Product Lines: Practices and Patterns., , Addison Wesley Professional; Schultis, K.-B., Elsner, C., Lohmann, D., Architecture challenges for internal software ecosystems: A large-scale industry case study (2014) 22nd ACM SIGSOFT Int.

Therefore, the perspectivesbusiness, organization and high-level architecture need to be taken into account before deriving a detailed software design. In this paper, we present our vision and first results of SECO patterns, which capture solutions for recurring high-level problems in software ecosystems. They can be used standalone, but our vision also includes a two-step decision support system to aid the architect in two complex decisions: At first, it can propose relevant SECO patterns to support feature selection. The proposals are based on the specific characteristics of the software ecosystem of interest, which have to be provided by the architect. In a second step, the decision support system can aid the architect in applying a selected SECO pattern. For this step, we reuse the method and knowledge base of CoCoADvISE to provide guidance on decision making regarding the detailed software architecture. © 2016 IEEE.;"Architectural Decision; Decision Support System; Seco Pattern; Software Ecosystems";"Artificial intelligence; Computer software reusability; Decision making; Ecology; Ecosystems; Knowledge based systems; Software architecture; Software design; Architectural decision; Complex decision; High level architecture; Knowledge base; Provide guidances; Seco Pattern; Software ecosystems; Decision support systems";;;;;;;"Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 13th International Software Product Line Conference, pp. 111-119. , ser.

We use both terms, as well as the Business Model Canvas (BMC) methodology, to design a digital ecosystem model for healthcare and wellness called DE4HW; the model considers economic, technological, and legal asymmetries, which are present on e-services beyond geographical regions. BMC methodology was embedded into the global project strategy called: IBOT (Initiate, Build, Operate and Transfer); it is a methodology to establish a functional, integrated national telemedicine network and virtual education network; of which we took its phases rationale. The results in this work illustrate the design of DE4HW model, into the first phase of IBOT, enriched with the BMC, which enables us to define actors, their interactions, rules and protocols, in order to build DE4HW, while IBOT strategy manages the project goal, up to the transfer phase, where an integral service platform of healthcare and wellness is turned over to stakeholders. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.";"Business canvas model; Digital ecosystem; Healthcare; Legal e-Health requirements; Wellness";"ecosystem; education; human; human experiment; model; telemedicine; computer system; health care delivery; nonbiological model; satisfaction; system analysis; telemedicine; Computer Systems; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Models, Organizational; Personal Satisfaction; Systems Integration; Telemedicine";;;;;;;"Altshuller, G., Shulyak, L., Rodman, S., The innovation algorithm: TRIZ, systematic innovation and technical creativity: Technical Innovation Center (1999) Inc.; Christensen, H.B., Hansen, K.M., Kyng, M., Manikas, K., Analysis and design of software ecosystem architectures towards the 4s telemedicine ecosystem (2014) Inf.

CVE and LVE respectively represent the traditional social media service ecosystem and a new (future) ecosystem governed by service platforms. In our stylized model, the architecture of the social media platform ecosystem (to be briefly referred as the 'value ecosystem') is composed of user group, SP (Service Platform) and CP (Contents Provider). Specifically, users are uniformly populated over [0,δ], where δ represents the span of users' preference for the social media services. We also emphasize the differences in the SDP and resulting service provisioning of the value ecosystems. Accordingly, the roles of players are different in two ecosystems. Multi-stage game models are employed for analyses and comparisons of players' optimal behaviors and the value-creation capability in each value ecosystem. In particular, the latter is measured by the amount of information created in the respective ecosystem. Our first analysis indicates that the user group is segmentized differently across the value ecosystems. Subsequently, following analysis presents equilibrium strategies of SP and CP. According to our analyses and experiments, it is more likely that the overall level of the social media services in LVE is higher than that in CVE. However, the total amount of information created throughout CVE is larger than that in LVE. These findings imply that the leadership of SP may boost or constrain the value ecosystem. We also demonstrate that the user diversity measured by δ is another key parameter for value creation in these ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier Inc..;"Equilibrium analysis; Social media service; Stage game.";"Ecology; Social networking (online); Amount of information; Equilibrium analysis; Equilibrium strategy; Service provisioning; Service-delivery process; Social media platforms; Social media services; Stage game; Ecosystems; information and communication technology; Internet; media industry; social network; valuation";;;;;KHU—20120757, Kyung Hee University;“This work was supported by a grant from the Kyung Hee University in 2012” ( KHU—20120757 ).;"Adner, R., Match your innovation strategy to your innovation ecosystem (2006) Harv.

In an emerging market, a consumer electronics firm may need to create a new ecosystem or adopt a newly developed platform, both which has significant commercial and technical implications. In this paper we identify three types of ecosystems that are used today: vertically integrated hardware/software platforms, closed-source software platforms, and open-source software platforms. We introduce a first step towards a multi-criteria decision support method, which determines what type of ecosystem is most suitable for a specific product category from a software engineering perspective. We use this method to analyze a wide range of consumer electronics products. The analysis shows that the vertically integrated platform type is most suitable for product with a high degree of innovation, and open-source software platforms are more suitable when a large amount of variants are needed. The closed-source software platform type is less suitable for most types of consumer electronics devices. This first step towards a full-fledged decision support method can be used by platform owners to decide whether their platform can also be successfully transferred to another product type.

Thus, an effective API Economy initiative has to be comprehensive, focusing not only on technical issues but also on other complementary dimensions. This paper illustrates a successful API Economy initiative, the E015 Digital Ecosystem developed for Expo Milano 2015, showing how a comprehensive approach to information systems interoperability and Service-Oriented Architectures can foster synergetic collaboration between industry and academia in particular, hence enabling the development of value-added solutions for the end-users. © 2016 ACM.;"API Economy; APIs; Application mashup; Collaboration mechanisms; Digital assets; Digital Ecosystems; E015; Expo Milano 2015; ICT governance; Interoperability; Service-oriented architectures; Standards and guidelines; Web services";"Application programming interfaces (API); Ecology; Ecosystems; Engineering research; Industrial management; Industrial research; Information services; Interoperability; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Software engineering; Web services; API Economy; APIs; Collaboration mechanisms; Digital assets; Digital ecosystem; E015; Expo Milano 2015; ICT governance; Mash-up; Standards and guidelines; Industrial economics";;;;;;;"Brandenburger, A.M., Nalebuff, B.J., (2011) Coopetition, , Crown Business, New York, NY; Gat, I., Succi, G., (2013) A Survey of the API Economy.

While the public broadband infrastructure is being deployed, some more actions are being performed by local innovation agencies. The TasLab is a project sustained by the local government and created by the local ICT agency for the public administration, the University of Trento and CREATE-NET, a research center that aims to develop interoperable and open-source based services through participated processes on the local broadband infrastructure. The TasLab is an idea based on the Living Laboratory framework, the Tripole of Innovation model and the Digital Ecosystems architecture. At the end of this early phase the TasLab is now looking for concrete users and innovation projects, aiming to sustain a fluid P2P and open-source based cooperation between agencies in order to create interoperable services and new opportunities. © 2008 Nottingham University.;"Digital Ecosystems; Distributed Architecture; Interoperability; Living Labs; Regional Innovation";"Ecology; Ecosystems; Industrial management; Public administration; Regional planning; Broadband infrastructure; Digital ecosystem; Distributed architecture; Interoperable services; Living lab; Living laboratories; Regional innovation; University of Trento; Interoperability";;;;;;;"European commission (2001) Communication from the Commission, , Helping SMEs to ""go digital COM(2001)136 final. 2001, 13 March; Moore, M., Predators and prey (1993) A New Ecology of Competition, pp. 75-86. , Harvard Business Review May-June 1993; Moore, M., Digital business ecosystems in developing countries (2003) An Introduction, Berkman Center for Internet and Society, , http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/bold/devel03/modules/episodeII.html, Harvard Law School; Nachira, F., (2002) Toward A Network of Digital Business Ecosystems Fostering the Local Development, , http://www.europa.eu.int/information_society/topics/ebusiness/godigital/sme_research/index_en.htm; Nachira, F., Nicolai, A., Dini, P., Le Luoarn, M., Rivera Leon, L., (2007) Digital Business Ecosystems, Europen Commission, Bruxelles; (2004) Progetto la Società Dell'Informazione, , http://www.giunta.provincia.tn.it/binary/pat_giunta/documenti/ProgSocietaInformazione.1115820239.pdf; (2004) Disposizioni in Materia di Urbanistica, Tutela dell'Ambiente, Acque Pubbliche, Trasporti, Servizio Antincendi, Lavori Pubblici e Caccia, , http://www.consiglio.provincia.tn.it/documenti_pdf/clex_11777.pdf, Legge provinciale 15 dicembre 2004, n. 10; (2005) Approvazione Delle ""Linee Guida per i Progetti Larga Banda-Indirizzi per le Strutture e le Società Controllate Dalla Provincia, , http://www.delibere.provincia.tn.it/scripts/gethtmlDeli.asp?Item=0andType=HTML, e dello schema di convenzione tra la Provincia e Tecnofin Immobiliare S.r.l. per la realizzazione dell'infrastruttura di rete provinciale per la larga banda.

A software ecosystem is a collection of software systems that have been developed to coexist and evolve together. The stakeholders of such a system need a variety of models to give them a perspective of the possibilities of the system, to evaluate specific quality attributes, and to extend the system. A powerful representation when building or using software ecosystems is the use of architectural models, which describe the structural aspects of such a system. These models have value for security and compliance, are useful to build new systems, can be used to define service contracts, find where quality factors can be monitored, and to plan further expansion. We have described a cloud ecosystem in the form of a pattern diagram where its components are patterns and reference architectures. A pattern is an encapsulated solution to a recurrent problem. We have recently expanded these models to cover fog systems and containers. Fog Computing is a highly-virtualized platform that provides compute, storage, and networking services between end devices and Cloud Computing Data Centers; a Software Container provides an execution environment for applications sharing a host operating system, binaries, and libraries with other containers. We intend to use this architecture to answer a variety of questions about the security of this system as well as a reference to design interacting combinations of heterogeneous components. We defined a metamodel to relate security concepts which is being expanded. © 2016 by the authors.";"Architecture patterns; Cloud computing; Reference architectures; Security patterns; Software ecosystems; Systems security";"Application programs; Cloud computing; Computer architecture; Containers; Digital storage; Ecology; Ecosystems; Architecture patterns; Reference architecture; Security patterns; Software ecosystems; Systems security; Distributed computer systems";;;;;;;"Lungu, M., Reverse Engineering Software Ecosystems (2009) Ph.D. Thesis, , University of Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 13th International Software Product Line Conference, pp. 111-119. , In San Francisco, CA, USA, 24-28 August; Cisco Cloud Strategy for Cloud Providers http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/cloud-infrastructure/at-a-glance-c45-730761.pdf, (accessed on 15 April 2016); Basilier, H., Darula, M., Wilke, J., Virtualization network services-The telecom cloud (2014) Ericsson Rev., 3, pp. 2-9; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A Sense of Community: A Research Agenda for Software Ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Software Engineering, , In New and Emerging Research Track, Vancouver, Canada, 16-24 May; Boucharas, V., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Formalizing software ecosystem modeling (2009) Proceedings of the 1st InternationalWorkshop on Open Component Ecosystems, , In Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 24 August; Mazhelis, O., Luoma, E., Warma, H., Defining an Internet-of-Things ecosystem (2012) Proceedings of the NEW2AN/ruSMART 2012, pp. 1-14. , In San Petersburg, Russia, 27-29 August; Fernandez, E.B., (2013) Security Patterns in Practice: Building Secure Architectures Using Software Patterns, , John Wiley & Sons: Chichester, UK; Fernandez, E.B., Monge, R., Hashizume, K., Building a security reference architecture for cloud systems (2015) Requir.

Adaptation of cloud computing services for robotic applications is relatively straightforward while adaptation of underlying ideas will require a new design attitude. Cloud computing is a cost-effective and dynamic business model. Currently cloud robotics is understood as a client server methodology which enables robots utilize resources and services placed at centralized servers. These cloud servers treat robots as any other client computer offering them platform, infrastructure, process or algorithm as a service. HTM5 is an OMG MDA based multi-view meta-model for agent oriented development of cloud robotic systems. HTM5 encourages design of peer-to-peer service ecosystems based on an open registry and matchmaking mechanism. In peer-to-peer cloud robotics, a robot can trade its hardware, software and functional resources as a service to other robots in the ecosystem. The peer-to-peer trade in such systems may be driven by contracts and relationships between its member agents. This article discusses trade-view model of HTM5 methodology and its use in developing a cloud robotic ecosystem that implements peer-to-peer, contract based economy. The article also presents a case study with experiments that implement distributed artificial intelligence and peer-to-peer service oriented trade on simulated and real robot colonies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;"Business model; Cloud computing; Cloud robotics; Model driven architecture; Multi-agent systems; Peer-to-peer system";"Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Ecology; Ecosystems; Intelligent agents; Intelligent robots; Multi agent systems; Peer to peer networks; Robotics; Robots; Software architecture; Software design; Agent oriented development; Business modeling; Cloud computing services; Cloud robotics; Distributed Artificial Intelligence; Dynamic business models; Model driven architectures; Peer-to-Peer system; Distributed computer systems";;;;;;;"https://sites.google.com/site/deidbep2psimulations/, Dynamic Electronic Institutions, Digital Business Ecosystem and Peer to Peer Cloud Robotics Simulation Videos (2014); A survey on parallel and distributed multi-agent systems (2014) Euro-Par 2014: Parallel processing workshops, 8805, pp. 371-382; Aldewereld, H., Vazquez Salceda, J., Dignum, F., Meyer JJC (2005) Norm compliance of protocols in electronic institutions Proceedings of the fourth international joint conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, AAMAS ’05.

This paper provides a software tool to develop ubiquitous applications adopting the philosophy of agents and services as data sources. ADELE (Agent Dynamic EvoLutionary at runtime) is a middleware that allows developers to create reactive agents with the capability to evolve through the injection of external behaviors at runtime. An ADELE external behavior is a software component that allows agents to accomplish their goals. To facilitate the programming of these behaviors, agents can obtain the information consuming local and public web services (WSs) previously published on different services ecosystems. This paper shows how a Multi-agent System can consume heterogeneous WSs to satisfy the agent goals using a normative model. We have created three add-ons compatible with SOAP, RESTful, and Doha (Dynamic Open Home-Automation) WS model. The integration of these add-ons within the ADELE tool is helpful to facilitate the invocation of heterogeneous WSs with a high abstraction level. In addition, we describe as an example, an Internet of Thing (IoT) scenario where the approach presented in this paper is very helpful. Finally, we also evaluate an ADELE application for giving home comfort employing heterogeneous WSs. © 2016 The Authors.;"ADELE; Doha; dynamic client; Multi-agent; RESTFul; service ecosystem; SOAP; web service";"Application programs;

This has seen the appearance of increasingly complex Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) scenarios featuring various partnership levels, increased resilience and adaptation to tougher compliance regulations, more seamless integration with process layers, etc. This complexity has brought about the need to broaden the SOA paradigm, so as to include business, infrastructure and multi-layering, resulting in an evolved concept known as Service-Oriented Enterprise Architecture (SOEA). This paper aims to describe the way new business and technology paradigms continue to affect the new SOEA approach and how the inherently holistic Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks and related practices can support the emerging complex dynamic, multi-layered and value-chained service-based scenario. © 2015 IEEE.;"Enterprise architecture; Service-oriented architecture; Service-oriented enterprise architecture";"Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Information services; Collaborative innovation; Compliance regulations; Enterprise Architecture; Next generation services; Organizational structures; Seamless integration; Service oriented enterprise architectures (SOEA); Service-oriented enterprise architectures; Service oriented architecture (SOA)";;;;;;;"Mata, F.J., Fuerst, W.L., Barney, J.B., Information technology and sustained competitive advantage: A resource-based analysis (1995) MIS Quarterly, 19, pp. 487-505. , Dec; Briscoe, G., De Wilde, P., Digital Ecosystems: Evolving serviceoriented architectures (2006) Conference on Bio Inspired Models of Network, Information and Computing Systems, , IEEE Press; Bishop, J., Increasing participation in online communities: A framework for human-computer interaction (2007) Computers in Human Behavior, 23 (4), pp. 1881-1893. , Elsevier Science Publishers; Nachira, F., Nicolai, A., Dini, P., Le Louarn, M., Leon, L.R., (2007) Digital Business Ecosystems, , http://www.digital-ecosystems.org/book/debook2007.html; Haki, M.K., Forte, M.W., Service oriented enterprise architecture framework (2010) Proceedings 6th World Congress on Services, Miami (US, pp. 391-398; Jarvinen, P.H., Research questions guiding selection of an appropriate research method (2000) Proceedings European Conference on Information Systems, Paper 26; Mentz, J., Van Der Merwe Alta, Paula, K., A comparison of practitioner and researcher definitions of enterprise architecture using an interpretation method (2012) Advances in Enterprise ISII, pp. 11-26. , C.

In the scientific scope, there is a clear commitment to the Open Knowledge, the use of Open Source technologies and the Open Access to Science, which have a directly impact in the scientific institutions. In this context, the PhD Programmes are scientific communities where early-stage and veteran researchers collaborate in the knowledge creation and in its visibility and dissemination. The aim of this paper is describe the architecture of the technological ecosystem that supports the scientific knowledge management processes in the PhD Programme on Education in the Knowledge Society at the University of Salamanca.;"Information System; PhD Programme; Quality; Scientific Knowledge Management; Software Architecture; Technological Ecosystem";"Ecology; Image quality; Information management; Information systems; Knowledge management; Open source software; Software architecture; Knowledge creations; Knowledge society; Open Access; Open-source technology; PhD Programme; Scientific community; Scientific institutions; Scientific knowledge management; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Anderson, D.J., (2010) Kanban, , Blue Hole Press; Attwell, G., The personal learning environments-The future of eLearning?

None of the existing architecture evaluation methods evaluate the unique aspects of the architectures that drive a software ecosystem. These architectures emphasize properties, such as Extensibility, Flexibility, and Scalability, that should be considered during an architecture evaluation. An evaluation method must also allow stakeholders, who are spread around the world, to participate in the evaluation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method, Architectural Analysis Method for Evolving Ecosystems (AAMEE), to evaluate the architecture that is the basis for a software ecosystem. AAMEE, a variant of ATAM, analyzes architectural scenarios covering both the platform and product architectures in the ecosystem. The method has been piloted through its application to the architecture of the Noosfero ecosystem.

The lack of a universally accepted set of modelling methods is hampering the advancement of software ecosystems research. Using a literature study and a set of interviews amongst peers, we aim to establish a set of understandings and requirements for a universally accepted set of software ecosystem modelling methods. The work is an initial push in a larger research initiative that has the goal of advancing the maturity of (software) ecosystems modelling. The success of such an initiative will be found in the availability of common databases, better interchange formats between researchers, and more capable software ecosystem modelling tools. © 2015 ACM.;;"Computational linguistics; Ecology; Modeling languages; Software architecture; Interchange formats; Literature studies; Modelling method; Modelling softwares; Research initiatives; Software ecosystems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Manikas, K., Hansen, K.M., Software ecosystems-A systematic literature review (2012) Journal of Systems and Software, 86, pp. 1294-1306; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems (2009) Software Engineering-Companion Volume 2009 ICSE-Companion 2009. 31st International Conference on, pp. 187-190. , IEEE; Barbosa, O., Alves, C., A systematic mapping study on software ecosystems (2011) Proceedings of the Workshop on Software Ecosystems; Basole, R.C., Clear, T., Hu, M., Mehrotra, H., Stasko, J., Understanding interfirm relationships in business ecosystems with interactive visualization, Visualization and Computer Graphics (2013) IEEE Transactions on, 19 (12), pp. 2526-2535; Hunink, I., Van Erk, R., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Industry taxonomy engineering: The case of the european software ecosystem (2010) Proceedings of the Fourth European Conference on Software Architecture: Companion Volume, pp. 111-118. , ACM; Janner, T., Schroth, C., Schmid, B., Modelling service systems for collaborative innovation in the enterprise software industry-The St. Gallen media reference model applied (2008) Services Computing 2008 SCC08 IEEE International Conference on, 2, pp. 145-152. , IEEE; Karhu, K., Tang, T., Hämäläinen, M., Analyzing competitive and collaborative differences among mobile ecosystems using abstracted strategy networks (2014) Telematics and Informatics, 31 (2), pp. 319-333; Karhu, K., Botero, A., Vihavainen, S., Tang, T., Hämäläinen, M., A digital ecosystem for co-creating business with people (2011) Journal of Emerging Technologies in Web Intelligence, 3 (3), pp. 197-205; Van Angeren, J., Blijleven, V., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Complementor embeddedness in platform ecosystems: The case of google apps (2013) Digital Ecosystems and Technologies (DEST) 2013 7th IEEE International Conference on, pp. 37-42. , IEEE; Basole, R.C., Park, H., Barnett, B.C., Coopetition and convergence in the ict ecosystem Telecommunications Policy; Burkard, C., Draisbach, T., Widjaja, T., Buxmann, P., Software ecosystems: Vendor-sided characteristics of online marketplaces (2011) Informatik; Myers, M.D., Avison, D., Qualitative research in information systems (1997) Management Information Systems Quarterly, 21, pp. 241-242; Robson, C., (2002) Real Word Research, , Oxford: Blackwell; Basole, R., Karla, J., On the evolution of mobile platform ecosystem structure and strategy (2011) Business & Information Systems Engineering, 3 (5), pp. 313-322; Basole, R.C., Bellamy, M.A., Visual analysis of supply network risks: Insights from the electronics industry (2014) Decision Support Systems, 67, pp. 109-120; Basole, R.C., Putrevu, J., On leadership, alliance formation, and enterprise transformation (2014) Journal of Enterprise Transformation, 4 (1), pp. 28-50; Iyer, B., Ecosysnetworks: A method for visualizing software ecosystems (2012) Proceedings of 4th International Workshop on Software Ecosystems, p. 1; Yu, S., Woodard, C.J., Innovation in the programmable web: Characterizing the mashup ecosystem (2009) Service-Oriented Computing-ICSOC 2008 Workshops, pp. 136-147. , Springer; Dreyfus, D., Iyer, B., Managing architectural emergence: A conceptual model and simulation (2008) Decision Support Systems, 46 (1), pp. 115-127; Mödritscher, F., Taferner, W., Soylu, A., De Causmaecker, P., Visualization of networked collaboration in digital ecosystems through two-mode network patterns (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems, pp. 158-162. , ACM; Van Angeren, J., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Exploring the relationship between partnership model participation and interfirm network structure: An analysis of the office365 ecosystem (2014) Software Business.

However, it appears that three main platforms account for roughly half of the market share: Magento, PrestaShop, and WooCommerce. This paper evaluates these platforms from a software ecosystems health perspective. By shedding light on the success factors of these ecosystems, we aim at establishing what makes an e-commerce ecosystem healthy. This knowledge provides ecosystem orchestrators with an overview of the current health of these ecosystems, and researchers with an application of ecosystem health assessment. © 2015 ACM.;"E-Commerce Platform; Health Assessment; Magento; PrestaShop; Software Ecosystem; WooCommerce.";"Commerce; Competition; Ecology; Electronic commerce; Health; Software architecture; Health assessments; Magento; PrestaShop; Software ecosystems; WooCommerce; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"(2014) Customer Migration Analytics in E-commerce Platforms Datanyze, , http://bit.ly/1dtnz, Accessed: 2014-12-27; Den Hartigh, E., Visscher, W., Tol, M., Jiménez, A., Measuring the health of a business ecosystem (2013) Software Ecosystems, pp. 221-246; (2014) Google Trends-Web Search Interest-Worldwide 2004-present, , http://bit.ly/trendseco, Accessed: 2014-11-29; Hyrynsalmi, S., (2014) Letters from the War of Ecosystems, , PhD dissertation, University of Turku; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., Strategy as ecology (2004) Harvard Business Review, 82 (3), pp. 68-78; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., Keystones and dominators: Framing operating and technology strategy in a business ecosystem (2004) Harvard Business School; (2013) Improved Magento Partner Program: Levels Now (Actually) Based on Quality!-Guido Jansen, , http://bit.ly/1IAClNf, Accessed: 2014-11-29; Jansen, S., Measuring the health of open source software ecosystems: Beyond the scope of project health (2014) Information and Software Technology, 56 (11), pp. 1508-1519; Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Finkelstein, A., Business network management as a survival strategy (2013) Software Ecosystems, pp. 29-42; Jansen, S., Cusumano, M., Brinkkemper, S., Defining software ecosystems (2013) Software Ecosystems, pp. 13-28; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems (2009) 2009 31st International Conference on Software Engineering-Companion Volume; Jansen, S., Van Capelleveen, G., Quality review and approval methods for extensions in software ecosystems (2013) Software Ecosystems, pp. 187-217; Lingen, S., Palomba, A., Lucassen, G., On the software ecosystem health of open source content management systems (2013) International Workshop on Software Ecosystems; Lucassen, G., Van Rooij, K., Jansen, S., Ecosystem health of cloud paas providers (2013) Software Business. from Physical Products to Software Services and Solutions; (2014) Magento History and Evolution Through the Years, , http://bit.ly/maghistory, Accessed: 2014-11-15; Thelwall, M., Stuart, D., Web crawling ethics revisited: Cost, privacy, and denial of service (2006) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 57 (13), pp. 1771-1779. , 2006";;;;Association for Computing Machinery;European Conference on Software Architecture Workshops, ECSAW 2015;7 September 2015 through 11 September 2015;;118776;;9,78145E+12;;;English;ACM Int.

Our ob-servation is that the software community has viewed and used plug-ins as powerful extension mechanisms oering a wide range of quality properties. Looking beyond such low-level technical interpretation, we argue that pluggable sys-tems should be perceived and treated as a higher level ar-chitectural pattern. In order to back our perspective we present the pattern following widely adopted documenta-tion scheme, we show example usage of the pattern in the Eclipse ecosystem, and we discuss different implementation options of the pattern when building new technical solutions for ecosystems. © 2015 ACM.;"Architectural Patterns; Plug-In Systems; Software Ecosystems";"Ecology; Software architecture; Architectural pattern; Extension mechanisms; Plug-in architectures; Plug-ins; Quality properties; Software ecosystems; Technical solutions; Technological platform; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Buschmann, F., Meunier, R., Rohnert, H., Sommerlad, P., Stal, M., (1996) Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: A System of Patterns, , Wiley; Christensen, H.B., Hansen, K.M., Kyng, M., Manikas, K., Analysis and design of software ecosystem architectures aas towards the 4s telemedicine ecosystem (2014) Information and Software Technology, 56 (11), pp. 1476-1492; Da Coelho Martins, F.J.C., Amorim Vieira, M.P., A practical experience on the impact of plugins in web security (2014) SRDS, pp. 21-30. , IEEE Computer Society, 2014; Jansen, S., Capelleveen, G., Quality review and approval methods for extensions in software ecosystems (2013) Software Ecosystems, pp. 187-217. , Edward Elgar Publishing; Jansen, S., Cusumano, M., Brinkkemper, S., (2013) Software Ecosystems: Analyzing and Managing Business Networks in the Software Industry, , Edward Elgar, Publishers; Messerschmitt, D.G., Szyperski, C., (2005) Software Ecosystem: Understanding An Indispensable Technology and Industry, , Cambridge, MA, USA, MIT Press.

Opening product architectures and platforms for third parties, designing closed innovation networks among partners through APIs and SDKs, coordinating multiple platforms, or participative engineering across organizational borders are all variants of ecosystems that come with their own opportunities and threats at the same time. The 3rd International Workshop on Ecosystem Architectures (WEA 2015) is co-organized with the 7th Workshop on Software Ecosystems (IWSECO 2015). IWSECO and WEA aim to further increase the body of knowledge on software ecosystems by providing a forum to exchange ideas and discuss the most recent innovations, trends and experiences in the field. They aim to build and shape the community of leading practitioners and research experts by providing forums for the exchange of research results and industrial practice in software ecosystems. WEA-IWSECO 2015 is a venue for both practitioners and researchers to discuss problems, solutions and lessons learned related to software development in the context of software ecosystems. The technical program covers a wide range of current research in both, business and social perspective and the technology and architecture perspective of software ecosystems. © 2015 ACM.;;"Ecology; Industrial research; Knowledge management; Network architecture; Product design; Software architecture; Software design; Closed innovations; Engineering challenges; Industrial practices; International workshops; Product architecture; Social perspective; Software ecosystems; Technical programs; Ecosystems";;;;;;;;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;European Conference on Software Architecture Workshops, ECSAW 2015;7 September 2015 through 11 September 2015;;118776;;9,78145E+12;;;English;ACM Int.

Access to accumulated and documented architectural knowledge facilitates this pro-cess. In this paper, we present a set of tools that support creative decision making in the different stages an archi-tecture specification goes through. These tools are struc-tured around a central repository, where acquired knowl-edge is stored for reuse. The approach is motivated by the challenges arising from the particular needs of the software ecosystem environment, where the software design process is characterized by the participation of multiple and diverse stakeholders and the existence of multiple software appli-cations built on a common platform. Our aim is to pro-vide tool support for making quality-driven design decisions in a exible and reusable manner, facilitating the system's evolvability, as well as enhancing its understandability to the stakeholders involved. © 2015 ACM.;;"Architectural design; Decision making; Design; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Product design; Software architecture; Architectural design decisions; Architectural knowledge; Common platform; Design decisions; Different stages; Software design process; Software ecosystems; Understandability; Software design";;;;;;;"Bass, L., Clements, P., Kazman, R., (2003) Software Architecture in Practice, , Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA, 2 edition; Bass, L.J., Klein, M., Bachmann, F., Quality attribute design primitives and the attribute driven design method (2002) Revised Papers from the 4th International Workshop on Software Product-Family Engineering, PFE '01, pp. 169-186. , Springer-Verlag, London, UK, UK; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 13th International Software Product Line Conference, SPLC '09, pp. 111-119. , Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Buschmann, F., Meunier, R., Rohnert, H., Sommerlad, P., Stal, M., (1996) Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture, 1. , A System of Patterns Wiley, Chichester, UK; Farenhorst, R., Izaks, R., Lago, P., Van Vliet, H., A just-in-Time architectural knowledge sharing portal (2008) Software Architecture, pp. 125-134. , WICSA 2008.

Measurements of health in a software ecosystem are applied to inform on how the ecosystem is evolving, evaluate changes, and predict future states. In this study we in vestigate the inuence of software to the overall health of the ecosystem. We propose an approach of measuring the activ-ity of the ecosystem over time and identifying the inuence to health. We do this in two ways: (i) we study the evolution of the software network over time to identify changes in the structure of the software network and investigate whether they relate to general changes in the ecosystem. (ii) We propose the identification of the inuence of the indepen-dent software components to ecosystem health at an activity level. We do so by defining keystone and dominator activ-ities and propose tentative means of measuring them. We apply our proposed approach to the platform of the Apache Cordova ecosystem, an ecosystem with a community-based platform and independent contributions. Our analysis iden-tifies two points in time where the ecosystem is under major change. These points are confirmed independently by both the measures of software network and keystone and dominator activities. © 2015 ACM.;"Ecosystem health; Graph analysis; Software activity; Software ecosystems";"Arches; Ecology; Health; Network architecture; Software architecture; Activity levels; Ecosystem health; Graph analysis; Independent contributions; Measurements of; Software component; Software ecosystems; Software network; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Baars, A., Jansen, S., A framework for software ecosystem governance (2012) Software Business of Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 114, pp. 168-180. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg M.

While these ecosystems facilitate software development, the software architect must put care in not relying on assumptions on behaviors and policies of the ecosystem that may change with platform evolution. Based on our experience with developing analyses within MARPLE, a framework for software comprehension and architecture reconstruction, we propose an abstract, context-aware style for specifying software. In the spirit of decoupling computation from coordination, this style decouples the specification of the computations to be performed from the specification of the contexts where they must take place. Software described in this way exposes its primitives at a level of abstraction closer to that of the framework, enabling better reasoning on the features of the design, easing correct implementation, and fostering a better interaction between the software and the framework it relies on. © 2015 IEEE.;;"Ecology; Ecosystems; Software architecture; Specifications; Architecture reconstruction; Complex software; Context-Aware; Large software systems; Level of abstraction; Software architects; Software comprehension; Software design";;;;;;;"Arcelli Fontana, F., Zanoni, M., A tool for design pattern detection and software architecture reconstruction (2011) Information Sciences, 181 (7), pp. 1306-1324. , April; Brown, W.H., Malveau, R.C., McCormick, H.W.I., Mowbray, T.J., (1998) Antipatterns: Refactoring Software Architectures and Projects in Crisis, , John Wiley & Sons; Fowler, M., (1999) Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, , http://www.refactoring.com/, Boston, MA, USA: Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co.

In addition, reusable architectural knowledge has gained much importance in the industrial practice. In the process of architectural decision making, quality attributes constitute key drivers for designing software systems, therefore, it is important to document quality attributes along with the decisions captured. However, most of the current tools for management of architectural decisions focus mainly on capturing or sharing of design decisions. We propose to enrich a reusable architectural decision meta-model with quality attributes and introduce a corresponding tool. Our goal is to support software architects during decision making based on reusable decisions driven by quality attributes. Our approach was motivated by and applied in an industrial case study on a large-scale software ecosystem for smart cities, that constitute a complex and challenging system-of-systems domain. We applied our proposal in a few scenarios in the smart cities domain, in which the consideration of quality attributes is required to model reusable architectural knowledge adequately. © 2015 IEEE.;"architectural decision support; architectural design decision; quality attribute; smart city; software ecosystem";"Architectural design; Computer software reusability; Decision support systems; Design; Ecology; Ecosystems; Software architecture; Software engineering; Systems engineering; Architectural decision; Architectural design decisions; Quality attributes; Smart cities; Software ecosystems; Decision making";;;;;;;"Jansen, A., Bosch, J., Software architecture as a set of architectural design decisions (2005) 5th Working IEEE/IFIP Conf. on Software Architecture (WICSA), pp. 109-120. , Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

Our main goal is to share our first ideas and some observations we have been conducting in an empirical way. As such, Cloud SECOs bring the ecosystem environment to another level, with new challenges in all three dimensions: technology, social and business. Besides that, we have been observing a possible shift in the center of some SECOs, i.e., Those 'things' connected to the Internet have introduced new players - at least in the sense they interact with the environment by providing data. As new software architectures and technologies emerge to support the new scenario being drawn, our research tries to characterize this new ecosystem and identify challenges, providing a roadmap that could help new entrants. © 2015 IEEE.;"CAMSS; Cloud; Internet of things; IT architecture; Software ecosystem";"Clouds; Distributed computer systems; Ecology; Ecosystems; Internet; CAMSS; Ecosystem environment; IT architecture; Roadmap; Software ecosystems; Three dimensions; Internet of things";;;;;;;"Chesbrough, H.W., (2003) Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology, p. 72. , Harvard Business School Press; Santos, R.P., Werner, C.M.L., Revisiting the concept of components in Software Engineering from a software ecosystem perspective (2010) Proceedings of the 4th ECSA, pp. 135-142. , 2nd IWSE.

Several models have been proposed to identify and analyse the complex relationships in OSS-ecosystems. However, there is a lack of formal models, methodologies, tool support, and standard notations for OSS-ecosystems. In this paper we propose a general framework for support the OSS-ecosystems modelling process. This framework will allow the representation, synthesis, analysis, evaluation, and evolution of OSS-ecosystems. Design science methodology is proposed to create several artefacts and investigating the suitability of these artefacts in the OSS-ecosystem context. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.;"Framework; Modeling; Open source Software; Software ecosystem";"Computer software; Design; Ecology; Ecosystems; Models; Open systems; Software engineering; Complex relationships; Design science methodologies; Formal model; Framework; Modelling framework; Modelling process; Software ecosystems; Standard notation; Open source software";;;;;;;"Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Finkelstein, A., Business network management as a survival strategy: A tale of two software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Software Ecosystems, CEUR-WS, pp. 34-48; Mens, T., Claes, M., Grosjean, P., Serebrenik, A., (2014) Studying evolving software ecosystems based on ecological models, pp. 297-326. , Springer, Heidelberg; Yu, E., Deng, S., Understanding software ecosystems: A strategic modeling approach (2011) Proceedings of the 3th Workshop on Software Ecosystems, IWSECO, pp. 65-76; Yamakami, T., A three-layer view model of oss: Toward understanding of diversity of oss (2011) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology, ICACT, pp. 1190-1194; Moore, J.F., Predators and prey: A new ecology of competition (1993) Harvard Business Review, 71, pp. 75-83; Stanley, J., Briscoe, G., The ABC of digital business ecosystems (2010) Computer, Media and Telecommunications Law, 15, pp. 1-24. , P28; Briscoe, G., (2009) Digital Ecosystems, , PhD thesis, Imperial College London; Messerschmitt, D.G., Szyperski, C., (2005) Software Ecosystem: Understanding an Indispensable Technology and Industry, 1. , MIT Press Books, The MIT Press; Lungu, M., Malnati, J., Lanza, M., Visualizing gnome with the small project observatory (2009) Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Working Conference Mining Software Repositories, MSR, pp. 103-106; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 13th International Software Product Line Conference, SPLC 2009, pp. 111-119. , Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh; Wynn, D., Jr., Boudreau, M.C., Watson, R., (2008) Assessing the Health of an Open Source Ecosystem, , GI Publishing, New York; Hoving, R., Slot, G., Jansen, S., Python: Characteristics identification of a free open source software ecosystem (2013) Proceedings of the 7th IEEE International Conference on Digital Ecosystems and Technologies, DEST, pp. 13-18; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., (2004) The Keystone Advantage: What the New Dynamics of Business Ecosystems Mean for Strategy, Innovation, and Sustainability, , Harvard Business Press; López, L., Costal, D., Ayala, C.P., Franch, X., Glott, R., Haaland, K., Modelling and applying OSS adoption strategies (2014) ER 2014.

Creating and sustaining a software ecosystem is a challenging problem that involves numerous technical, organizational, and business concerns. To support the systematic design of software ecosystems, modeling is a crucial tool. In this paper, we (a) identify a set of descriptive and analytical requirements raised in the design of software ecosystems; (b) review several modeling techniques used for describing and examining software ecosystems; and (c) assess the support of the reviewed techniques towards addressing the identified requirements. The results provide insight into the gaps between the issues raised in the design of software ecosystems, and the coverage of the studied techniques, suggesting an agenda for future research. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015";"Analysis; Design; Modeling; Review; Software ecosystems";"C (programming language); Design; Ecology; Information systems; Management information systems; Models; Reviews; Software design; Systems analysis; Systems engineering; Analysis; Design of softwares; Designing softwares; Modeling technique; Software company; Software ecosystems; Software platforms; Systematic designs; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Iansiti, M., Levien, R., Strategy as ecology (2004) Harvard Business Review, 82 (3), pp. 68-81; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems (2009) 31St International Conference on Software Engineering-Companion, 2009, pp. 187-190; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009), pp. 111-119. , Carnegie Mellon University; Bosch, J., Software ecosystems: Taking software development beyond the boundaries of the organization (2012) Journal of Systems and Software, 85 (7), pp. 1453-1454; Jansen, S., Cusumano, M., Defining software ecosystems: A survey of software platforms and business network governance (2012) Proceedings of Fourth International Workshop on Software Ecosystems, pp. 41-58; Manikas, K., Hansen, K.M., Software ecosystems–a systematic literature review (2013) Journal of Systems and Software, 86 (5), pp. 1294-1306; Müller, R.M., Kijl, B., Martens, J.K., A comparison of inter-organizational business models of mobile app stores There is more than open vs closed (2011) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 6 (2), pp. 63-76; Lin, F., Ye, W., Operating system battle in the ecosystem of smartphone industry (2009) International Symposium on Information Engineering and Electronic Commerce.

Over the duration of a product life-cycle, product software vendors build up relationships with their suppliers and other partners, which range from informal acknowledgements of each other’s presence to strategic alliances. There is still a lack of understanding surrounding the roles, connections, relationships, and resulting networks within software ecosystems. Using modelling techniques and statistical analysis, these networks can be used as tools to further that understanding. In this paper a collection of 67 software supply networks will be modelled as a network graph. Using clustering and two extensions of basic software supply network data, we identify several major players and domains in the Dutch software industry. Three business strategy perspectives are then related to the data to provide an example of their potential practical use. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.;"Network modeling; Product software; Software business strategy; Software ecosystems modeling";"Complex networks; Ecology; Ecosystems; Life cycle; Planning; Software engineering; Strategic planning; Modelling techniques; Network modeling; Product life cycles; Product software; Software business; Software ecosystems; Software supply networks; Strategic alliance; Computer software reusability";;;;;;;"Van Den Berk, I., Jansen, S., Luinenburg, L., Software Ecosystems: A Software Ecosystem Strategy Assessment Model (2010) Proc.

Nevertheless, the rapidly growing utilization of communication networks and interconnections among software systems have introduced some critical challenges, which need to be handled in order to fully unleash the potential of these systems. In this respect, digital ecosystems, generally considered as a distributed adaptive open socio-technical system, have gained considerable attention, since their scale is incomparable to the traditional systems. The scale of socio-technical ecosystems makes drastic changes in various aspects of system development. As a result, it requires that we broaden our understanding of software architectures and the ways we structure them. In this paper, we investigate the lack of an architectural model framework for digital ecosystems interoperability, and propose an architectural model framework to improve digital ecosystems interoperability based on complex system theory. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.;"Architectural Model; Digital ecosystems interoperability; Framework; Software architecture; Software systems";"Complex networks; Computer software; Ecosystems; Network architecture; Software architecture; Architectural modeling; Complex software systems; Design and Development; Digital ecosystem; Framework; Networks and interconnections; Sociotechnical systems; Software systems; Interoperability";;;;;;;"Bass, L., Clements, P., Kazman, R., (2004) Software Architecture in Practice, , 2nd Edition, SEI Series in Software Architecture, Addison-Wesley Professional; (2000) Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software- Intensive Systems, , Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards board, IEEE-Std-1471-2000; (2000) Industrial Automation Systems—Requirements for Enterprise-Reference Architectures and Methodologies, , ISO 15704; Chen, D., Architectures for enterprise integration and interoperability: Past, present and future (2008) Comput Industry (Ind); Zachman, J.A., A Framework for Information Systems Architecture (1987) IBM Systems Journal, 26 (3), pp. 276-292. , Reprinted in 1999: Vol. 38, No. 2-3, 1999; (1999) Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework, , Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council, Version 1.1; (2000) Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework, , Department of the Treasury, Version 1; (2009) The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), , Open Group, Version 9.0, USA; C4ISR Architecture Framework, Version 2.0, USA (1997) Department of Defense (Dod), , C4ISR Architecture Working Group (AWG); (2006) Software Challenge of the Future, Technical Report, , Software Engineering Institute (SEI), Ultra-Large-Scale Systems, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Zhuge, H., Shi, X., Toward the Eco-grid: A Harmoniously Evolved Interconnection Environment (2004) Communications of the ACM, 47 (9), pp. 78-83; Joslyn, C., Rocha, L., Towards semiotic agent-based models of socio-technical organizations (2000) Proceedings of AI, Simulation and Planning in High Autonomy Systems (AIS 2000) Conference, pp. 70-79. , Tucson, Arizona, USA; Weaver, W., Science and Complexity (1948) American Scientist, 36, 536p. , Retrieved on 2007–11–21; Ostadzadeh, S.S., Rezaei Rad, B., Shams, F., An Interoperability Architectural Model based On Complex System Theory for the Ultra-Large-Scale Systems (2011) Proceedings of Software Engineering and Application (SEA’ 2011), , IASTED; (1998) Levels of Information Systems Interoperability (LISI); Clark, T., Jones, R., Organizational Interoperability Maturity Model for C2, , Department of Defense, Canberra, Australia; Athena, Advanced Technologies for Interoperability of Heterogeneous Enterprise Networks and their Applications (2003) Integrated Project, , FP6-2002- IST1; Interoperability Development for Enterprise Application and Software Roadmaps (2002) Annex 1—DoW, , IDEAS, IDEAS; (2004) IDA Working Document, , EIF, European Interoperability Framework for PAN-European eGovernment Services, Version 4.2; Tolk, A., Beyond Technical Interoperability: Introducing a Reference Model for Measures of Merit for Coalition Interoperability (2003) Proc. 8Th ICCRTS, , Washington, USA; (2005), eGovernment Unit, eGovernment Interoperability Framework (eGIF), version 6.1; Nehta, (2005) Towards an Interoperability Framework, , Version 1.8; (2003) NATO C3 Technical Architecture Reference Model for Interoperability, , NC3A, NATO Consultation, Command, and Control Agency; Morris, E., (2004) System of Systems Interoperability, , Technical Report.

None of the existing architecture evaluation methods evaluate the unique aspects of the architectures that drive a software ecosystem. These architectures emphasize properties, such as Extensibility, Flexibility, and Scalability, that should be considered during an architecture evaluation. An evaluation method must also allow stakeholders, who are spread around the world, to participate in the evaluation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method, Architectural Analysis Method for Evolving Ecosystems (AAMEE), to evaluate the architecture that is the basis for a software ecosystem. AAMEE, a variant of ATAM, analyzes architectural scenarios covering both the platform and product architectures in the ecosystem. The method has been piloted through its application to the architecture of the Noosfero ecosystem. We report some lessons learned. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.;"Architectural evaluation; Software architecture; Software ecosystems";"Ecology; Software architecture; Architectural analysis; Architectural evaluation; Architecture evaluation; Existing architectures; ITS applications; Product architecture; Reference architecture; Software ecosystems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Amorim, S.D.S., De Almeida, E.S., McGregor, J.D., Extensibility in ecosystem architectures: An initial study (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 International Workshop on Ecosystem Architectures, WEA 2013, pp. 11-15; Amorim, S.D.S., De Almeida, E.S., McGregor, J.D., Scalability of ecosystem architectures (2014) Proceedings of the 11Th Working IEEE/IFIP Conference on Software Architecture, WICSA 2014, pp. 49-52; Amorim, S.D.S., De Almeida, E.S., McGregor, J.D., Chavez, C.V.F.G., Flexibility in ecosystem architectures (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 European Conference on Software Architecture Workshops, ECSAW 2014, pp. 1-14; Bengtsson, P., Lassing, N., Bosch, J., Van Vliet, H., Architecture-level modifiability analysis (ALMA) (2004) Journal of Systems and Software, 69, pp. 129-141; Buschmann, F., Meunier, R., Rohnert, H., Stal, M., (1996), 1. , Wiley; Graaf, B., Van Dijk, H., Van Deursen, A., Evaluating an embedded software reference architecture (2005) Proceedings of the Ninth European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering, CSMMR 2005, pp. 354-363; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 31St International Conference on Software Engineering: Companion Volume, ICSE 2009, pp. 187-190; Jansen, S., How quality attributes of software platform architectures influence software ecosystems (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 International Workshop on Ecosystem Architectures, WEA 2013, pp. 6-10; Kazman, R., Klein, M., Barbacci, M., Longstaff, T., Lipson, H., Carriere, J., The architecture tradeoff analysis method (1998) Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems, ICECCS 1998, pp. 68-78; Knodel, J., Naab, M., Software architecture evaluation in practice-retrospective on more than 50 architecture evaluations in industry (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE/IFIP Conference on Software Architecture, WICSA 2014, pp. 115-124; Naab, N., Stammel, J., Architectural flexibility in a software-systems life-cycle: Systematic construction and exploitation of flexibility (2012) Proceedings of the 8Th International ACM SIGSOFT Conference on Quality of Software Architectures, Qosa 2012, pp. 13-22; Ram, N.S., Rodrigues, P., Enhanced quantitative trade-off analysis in quality attributes of a software architecture using bayesian network model JDCA, 3 (4); Taylor, R.N., Medvidovic, N., Dashofy, E.M., (2009), , : Wiley, January";"da Silva Amorim, S.; Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of BahiaBrazil; email: simone.amorim@ifba.edu.br";Crnkovic I.Weyns D.Mirandola R.;"ACM SIGDA;IEEE CEDA;IFIP TC 10 Working Group 10.5 (VLSI)";Springer New York LLC;9th European Conference on Software Architecture, ECSA 2015;7 September 2015 through 11 September 2015;;158939;18684238;9,78332E+12;;;English;IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology;Conference Paper;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84951058054

With the wide adoption of service-oriented architecture and cloud manufacturing, manufacturing enterprises and organisations publish their manufacturing capability, such as resources, processes and knowledge as manufacturing services. A rapidly growing manufacturing service ecosystem can be observed nowadays, which brings the information overload problem for the service selection. Thus, how to organise these services and how to recommend the reputable services become two important issues for the manufacturing service retrieval and reuse. In this paper, the service cluster method WSTPCluster, which develops the topic model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, is employed to cluster services into specific domains. As the service ecosystem can be modelled as a heterogeneous service network, a unified reputation propagation method URPM is proposed to calculate the reputation of services and to distinguish the reputable services in each domain. Combining WSTPCluster and URPM, domain-aware reputable service recommendation method is introduced to recommend the high reputable services in each domain for the consumers. Experiments show that this method brings a better performance both in the recommendation accuracy and in the long tail recommendation. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.;"Domain-aware reputable service recommendation; Heterogeneous network; manufacturing service ecosystem; Reputation propagation; Service clustering; Topic model";"Computer architecture; Ecosystems; Heterogeneous networks; Information services; Manufacture; Statistics; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Manufacturing capability; Manufacturing enterprise; Manufacturing service; Networked-manufacturing; Service clustering; Service recommendations; Topic Modeling; Service oriented architecture (SOA)";;;;;;;"Badr, Y., Peng, Y., Biennier, F.E.D.E., Digital Ecosystems for Business e-Services in Knowledge- Intensive Firms (2012) Business System Management and Engineering, LNCS, 7350, pp. 16-31. , edited by C.

Both opening up products and organizing a developer ecosystem around an organization are non-trivial. In this paper we provide a case study of a leading communications technology firm that opened up and platformized 11 product lines. First, we identify and describe four architecture patterns that are applied multiple times across these product lines. Also, the software ecosystems initiative is centralized in one central department, which has created a central knowledge hub for the creation of a software ecosystem. We highlight the guidelines collected by the central department, to assist technology firms in the platformization process and support them in their own software ecosystem creation efforts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.;"APIs; Case study; Extendible product lines; Extension patterns; Software ecosystems; Software platforms";"Ecology; Software architecture; APIs; Extension patterns; Product-lines; Software ecosystems; Software platforms; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Anvaari, M., Jansen, S., Evaluating architectural openness in mobile software platforms (2010) Proceedings of the Fourth European Conference on Software Architecture: Companion Volume, pp. 85-92. , ACM; Goeminne, M., Mens, T., A framework for analysing and visualising open source software ecosystems (2010) Proceedings of IWPSE-EVOL, pp. 42-47; Hanssen, G.K., Opening up software product line engineering (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 ICSE Workshop on Product Line Approaches in Software Engineering, pp. 1-7. , ACM; Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Finkelstein, A., Component assembly mechanisms and relationship intimacy in a software supply network (2008) 15Th International Annual Euroma Conference, Special Interest Session on Software Supply Chains; Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Hunink, I., Demir, C., Pragmatic and opportunistic reuse in innovative start-up companies (2008) IEEE Software, 25 (6), pp. 42-49; Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Souer, J., Luinenburg, L., Shades of gray: Opening up a software producing organization with the open software enterprise model (2012) Journal of Systems and Software, 85 (7), pp. 1495-1510; Jansen, S., Cusumano, M.A., Brinkkemper, S., Software Ecosystems: Analyzing and Managing Business Networks in the Software Industry (2013) Edward Elgar Publishing; Kabbedijk, J., Variability in Multi-Tenant Enterprise Software.

To support such collaboration, the development of an ecosystem of products and services for active ageing plays an important role. This article introduces a conceptual architecture that supports such care ecosystem. In order to facilitate understanding and better interrelate concepts, a 3-layered model is adopted: Infrastructure layer, Care and assistance services layer and Ambient Assisted Living ecosystem layer. A holistic perspective of ambient assisted living, namely considering four important life settings is adopted: (1) independent living; (2) health and care in life; (3) occupation in life and (4) recreation in life. The proposed architecture is designed in the context of a national Portuguese project and in accordance with the findings of a large European road mapping initiative on ICT and ageing. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.";"ambient assisted living; collaborative networks; ecosystem architecture; ICT and ageing; services ecosystem";"Architecture; Ecosystems; Network architecture; Ambient assisted living; Collaborative network; Conceptual architecture; Holistic perspectives; ICT and ageing; Multiple stakeholders; Products and services; Proposed architectures; Ecology";;;;;"FP7; programme";This work was funded in part by the Project AAL4ALL [QREN 13852], co-financed by the European Community Fund through ‘COMPETE – Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade’.

Developers’ intentions are to build apps that support a specific piece of functionality with great user experience, business often needs to cover a large spectrum of functionality. The results are Mobile software ecosystems (MSE), which usually consist of a large number of apps supporting a certain type of business and combine the strengths of multiple service providers. At a first glance, developing mobile software might look simple. Doing it for business and at an ecosystem scale makes it extremely challenging in practice. Initiating an MSE means to come up with an attractive set of apps that provide adequate openness so that other companies can contribute to them and increase the value of the ecosystem for customers. This paper describes an approach to build MSEs in their initial version. This approach is based on software engineering state-of-the-art practices from requirements engineering, user experience (UX) engineering, and software architecture. The paper elaborates the specifics of MSEs and describes how they can be addressed in the approach. The approach has been applied in a large-scale industrial case study in the agricultural domain in a joint project of John Deere and Fraunhofer IESE. Within that case study, lessons learned with regard to user experience and software architecture are derived and described in detail. Practitioners setting up an MSE can avoid these pitfalls by taking our lessons learned into account. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.;"App ecosystem; Human-computer-interaction; Mobile; Practical experiences; Software architecture; User experience";"Application programs; Computer software; Ecology; Ecosystems; Software architecture; Software engineering; Business software; Industrial case study; Mobile; Multiple services; Practical experience; State of the art; User experience; User experiences (ux); Human computer interaction";;;;;;;"Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) 13Th International Software Product Line Conference, SPLC 2009; Dörr, J., Trapp, M., Hess, S., (2014) Mobile Prozesse: Eine Chance für Die Wirtschaft, , http://www.computerwoche.de/a/mobile-prozesse-eine-chance-fuer-diewirtschaft,2555126, Computerwoche; Hess, S., Kiefer, F., Carbon, R., Maier, A., MConcAppt–a method for the conception of mobile business applications (2013) Mobicase 2012.

These systems are governed by regulators that supervise the services provided at the ecosystem level using systemic capabilities and resources. In the same way at the enterprise level, risk management at the ecosystem level is a paramount activity for the stability of the targeted sector. This paper proposes a metamodel for modelling the ecosystem capabilities and resources, a risk management approach based on this metamodel, and an ArchiMate extension language to sustain the systemic risk management. The approach is illustrated with a real case study from the Luxembourgish financial market. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.;"Business service; Capability; Regulation; Resource; Systemic risk";"Administrative data processing; Cognitive systems; Design; Ecology; Ecosystems; Enterprise resource management; Enterprise resource planning; Information systems; Management information systems; Modeling languages; Risk assessment; Risk management; Systems engineering; Business service; Capability; Regulation; Resource; Systemic risks; Information management";;;;;;;"España, S., González, T., Grabis, J., Jokste, L., Juanes, R., Valverde, F., Capability-Driven Development of a SOA Platform: A Case Study (2014) Caise Workshops 2014.

However, this intraorganizational decentralization causes architecture challenges that must be understood to reason about suitable architectural measures. We present an in-depth case study on collaboration and architecture challenges in two of these large-scale software projects at Siemens. We performed a total of 46 hours of semi-structured interviews with 17 leading software architects from all involved organizational units. Our major findings are: (1) three collaboration models on a continuum that ranges from high to low coupling, (2) a classification of architecture challenges, together with (3) a qualitative and quantitative exposure of the identified recurring issues along each collaboration model. Our study results provide valuable insights for both industry and academia: Practitioners that find themselves in one of the collaboration models can use empirical evidence on challenges to make informed decisions about counteractive measures. Researchers can focus their attention on challenges faced by practitioners to make software engineering more effective.

Today, software applications are increasingly distributed and consumed as a service, and business processes are implemented by selecting and composing services provided by different suppliers at run-time and with a minimal human intervention. In this scenario, where services are usually selected on the basis of clients' functional preferences, the risk of providing powerful but insecure applications raises, and the problem of guaranteeing and preserving the security of services and business processes becomes stringent. To this aim, we put forward the idea that security certification techniques can be adopted to provide the evidence that a service system has some security properties and behaves as expected. However, existing security certification techniques are not well-suited to the service scenario, since they are designed for static and monolithic software and then cannot support the intrinsic SOA dynamics. In this chapter, we discuss recent developments in the area of extending security certifications to web services. In particular, we first review current certification approaches, and highlight requirements and challenges for applying them to the service ecosystem. We then present an advanced methodology for security certification based on testing, as a crucial part of a novel approach for security certification developed in the context of the FP7 EU project Advanced Security Service cERTificate for SOA (ASSERT4SOA). © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

To obtain full value of this information it should reach right people at the right time. To investigate how this can be achieved we developed an information flow model for agriculture domain by mapping information needed by stakeholders to information generated by others using set of aggregation and disaggregation operators. We found majority of information needs of stakeholders can be fulfilled by applying these operators to information produced by some other stakeholders thus creating a direct benefit to encourage sharing information. This information flow model had many similarities to biological ecosystems where nutrient cycles and energy flows are replaced by information flows. Based on this information ecosystem model we are developing a mobile based information system for farmers in Sri Lanka. Like biological ecosystems information ecosystems will also need time to grow and become sustainable. Lasanthi N.C. De Silva, Jeevani S. Goonetillake, Gihan N.

Chavez, C., Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, BA 40170, Brazil";Quality attributes are important to creating, understanding, and evaluating software architectures. The architectural attributes and challenges for ecosystem architectures are different from one-off systems. The study of those aspects that influence quality attributes in this new environment can help to understand these architectures. In previous work, we hypothesized that the architecture for an ecosystem should be extensible, scalable, and flexible and reported initial investigations into extensibility and scalability. In this paper, we report on our investigation into flexibility. We analyze various features that impact how to design flexible architectures. We highlight that flexibility for ecosystems is not only a technical issue, but a business issue as well. We classified features that affect flexibility into business and technical dimensions. We adapted a software system metric for flexibility to measure the flexibility of an ecosystem's architecture. © 2014 ACM.;"D.2.11 [Software Engineering]: Software Architecture - data abstraction, patterns; D.2.2 [Software Engineering]: Design Tools and Techniques - modules and interfaces; D.2.8 [Software Engineering]: Metrics - Product metrics; D.2.9 [Software Engineering]: Management - Software quality assurance; Design; Management; Measurement; Software Architecture; Software Ecosystem";"Design; Ecosystems; Information management; Management; Measurements; Product design; Quality assurance; Software architecture; Data abstraction; Design tools and techniques; Product metrics; Software ecosystems; Software quality assurance; Computer software selection and evaluation";;;;;;;"MacCormack, A., Baldwin, C.Y., Rusnak, J., (2010) The Architecture of Complex Systems: Do Core-periphery Structures Dominate?, , Harvard Business School.

However, the deployment of telemedicine is faced with standards that are hard to use, application-specific data models, and application stove-pipes that inhibit the adoption of telemedical solutions. To which extent can a software ecosystem approach to telemedicine alleviate this? Objective In this article, we define the concept of software ecosystem architecture as the structure(s) of a software ecosystem comprising elements, relations among them, and properties of both. Our objective is to show how this concept can be used (i) in the analysis of existing software ecosystems and (ii) in the design of new software ecosystems. Method We performed a mixed-method study that consisted of a case study and an experiment. For (i), we performed a descriptive, revelatory case study of the Danish telemedicine ecosystem and for (ii), we experimentally designed, implemented, and evaluated the architecture of 4S. Results We contribute in three areas. First, we define the software ecosystem architecture concept that captures organization, business, and software aspects of software ecosystems. Secondly, we apply this concept in our case study and demonstrate that it is a viable concept for software ecosystem analysis. Finally, based on our experiments, we discuss the practice of software engineering for software ecosystems drawn from experience in creating and evolving the 4S telemedicine ecosystem. Conclusion The concept of software ecosystem architecture can be used analytically and constructively in respectively the analysis and design of software ecosystems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;"Software ecosystem architecture; Telemedicine software ecosystems; Third-party sponsored software ecosystems";"Design; Experiments; Software design; Telemedicine; Design of softwares; Mixed method; Quality of care; Reducing costs; Software ecosystems; Ecosystems";;;;;"7; Pioneer Hi-Bred";The research reported in this article has been supported by the Net4Care project that is funded by Caretech Innovation, 7 http://www.caretechinnovation.dk . 7 the Connect2Care project that is funded by the UNIK Partnership, 8 http://www.partnerskabetunik.dk . 8 and the project “Kick-start of Denmark as telemedicine pioneer country” that is funded by The National Board of Technology and Innovation. 9 http://www.alexandra.dk/dk/projekter/sider/kickstart-af-danmark-som-telemedicinsk-foregangsland.aspx . 9;"Barbosa, O., Alves, C., A systematic mapping study on software ecosystems (2011) Third International Workshop on Software Ecosystems (IWSECO-2011), pp. 15-26. , CEUR-WS; Barbosa, O., Santos, R.P., Alves, C., Werner, C., Jansen, S., Software ecosystems - Analyzing and managing business networks in the software industry (2013) Chapter: A Systematic Mapping Study on Software Ecosystems from A Three-Dimensional Perspective, pp. 59-81. , Jansen et al.

Those platforms project into software systems their own architecture and concepts and impose constraints, this strongly influences how components are developed and/or integrated. It is generally recognized that software architectures play a keyrole in managing software ecosystems and their evolution. While commercially there is an undeniable and increasing interest in software ecosystems, e.g., the Apple's iOS, Google's Android, Amazon.com, research in this domain is still in its infancy. This paper analyses, from the software architecture perspective, the state-of-the-art in software ecosystems and highlights future research directions from a technical point of view. © 2014 IEEE.;"open architectures; Software architecture; software ecosystems; software evolution";"Computer software; Software architecture; Amazon.com; Future research directions; Open architecture; Paper analysis; Software ecosystems; Software Evolution; Software platforms; Software systems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Inverardi, P., Autili, M., Di Ruscio, D., Pelliccione, P., Tivoli, M., Producing software by integration: Challenges and research directions (keynote) (2013) ESEC/FSE'13.

In this position paper, we characterize business, organizational, and in particular technical challenges, which the architect of such an open ecosystem has to address. One key challenge we identified is how to retain certain system qualities under the influence of multiple external system extensions. We provide an initial template with factors and potential values helping an architect in characterizing the open software system and its environment. Furthermore, we illustrate an open system by a fictional scenario from the agricultural domain. The discussion of the challenges, the characterization template and the example are significant steps towards a systematic engineering method establishing open ecosystems. © 2014 ACM.;"Openness; Software Architecture; Software Ecosystem";"Computer software; Open systems; Software architecture; External systems; Multiple organizations; Openness; Position papers; Potential values; Software ecosystems; Systematic engineering; Technical challenges; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Van Den Berk, I., Jansen, S., Luinenburg, L., Software ecosystems (2010) Proceedings of the Fourth European Conference on Software Architecture Companion Volume - ECSA '10 (New York, New York, USA, Aug. 2010), p. 127; Bosch, J., Architecture challenges for software ecosystems (2010) Proceedings of the Fourth European Conference on Software Architecture Companion Volume - ECSA '10 (New York, New York, USA, Aug. 2010), p. 93; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 13th International Software Product Splc (2009), pp. 1-10; Bosch, J., Bosch-Sijtsema, P.M., From integration to composition: On the impact of software product lines, global development and ecosystems (2010) Journal of Systems and Software, 83 (1), pp. 67-76. , Jan. 2010; Bosch, J., Bosch-Sijtsema, P.M., Softwares Product Lines, Global Development and Ecosystems: Collaboration in Software Engineering (2010) Collaborative Software Engineering, pp. 77-92. , I.

As software ecosystems become a new software development paradigm in software engineering processes, it is important and necessary to capture and represent ADDs in open software development, and to evolve architectural knowledge with minimum knowledge evaporation in the open ecosystem community. So far, little work has been done on managing architectural decisions in software ecosystems in current software architecture research and practice. In this research position paper, we discuss the typical characteristics of software ecosystems which may influence architecture decision-making processes in software development, and identify the essential aspects that should be considered for managing ADDs in the context of software ecosystem. In addition, we discuss major challenges of managing ADDs for software ecosystems, and we also propose possible directions in research to solve the problems. © 2014 IEEE.;"architectural design decisions; architectural knowledge; open software development; software ecosystems";"Architectural design; Knowledge management; Research; Software architecture; Software design; Architectural decision; Architectural design decisions; Architectural knowledge; Decision making process; Position papers; Software development process; Software ecosystems; Software engineering process; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Bosch, J., Software architecture: The next step (2004) European Workshop on Software Architecture, 3047, pp. 194-199. , of Lecture Notes in Computer Science.

A more distributed approach would have device capabilities offered directly on the network as services hosted by the user. These pervasive user-hosted services could be made discoverable and available over a public federated service infrastructure. The infrastructure would provide transport over an identity layer, where endpoints are addressed by their identities instead of network identifiers, and on top of which services can be exposed to be consumed by trusted friends or anonymous users, as the hosting user prefers. The work presented in this paper explores the possibility of implementing such a distributed social Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) over Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). This SOA, which would expose re-usable coarse-grained software components in a service ecosystem, differs from traditional SOA because it attempts to counter the centralization existing services, in favour of a fully-distributed service ecosystem where each peer can behave both as service consumer and provider. Finally, an analysis is done on how suitable XMPP is to serve as a base protocol for such infrastructure. © 2014 IEEE.;"Distributed computing; Middleware; Software architecture; Web services";"Middleware; Software architecture; Web services; Distributed computer systems";;;;;;;"Schroth, C., Janner, T., Web 2.0 and SOA: Converging concepts enabling the internet of services (2007) IT Professional, 9 (3), pp. 36-41. , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs\all.jsp?arnumber=4216107; Girão, J.A., Sarma, A.C., Identities in the future internet of things (2009) Wireless Personal Communications, 49 (3), pp. 353-363; Ludwig, S., Beda, J., Saint-Andre, P., McQueen, R., Egan, S., Hildebrand, J., (2009) XEP-0166: Jingle, , http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html; Saint-Andre, P., Hildebrand, J., Dobrov, S., Saliou, V., (2012) XEP-0277: Microblogging over XMPP, , http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0277.html; Waher, P., (2013) XEP-0323: Internet of Things-Sensor Data, , http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0323.html; Johansson, L., XMPP as MOM (2005) Greater NOrdic MIddleware Symposium (GNOMIS), , http://www.gnomis.org/presentasjoner/oslo2005/xmpp.pdf; Forno, F., Saint-Andre, P., (2005) XEP-0072: SOAP over XMPP, , http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0072.html; Doolin, K., (2013) SOCIETIES Completes Enterprise User Trial, , http://www.ict-societies.eu/2013/04/23/societies-completes-enterprise-user-trial/; Doolin, K., (2013) SOCIETIES Enterprise User Trial #2 Complete RELEVANCE @ ICT2013, , http://www.ict-societies.eu/2013/11/12/societies-enterprise-user-trial-2-complete-relevance-ict2013/; (2011) GitHub: SOCIETIES, , https://github.com/societies/, SOCIETIES; Hansen, M., Berlich, P., Camenisch, J., Clauß, S., Pfitzmann, A., Waidner, M., Privacy-enhancing identity management (2004) Information Security Technical Report, 9 (1), pp. 35-44. , Jan; (1999) XMPP Registrar, , http://xmpp.org/resources/registrar/, XMPP Standards Foundation; Hansen, M., Berlich, P., Camenisch, J., Clauß, S., Pfitzmann, A., Waidner, M., (1999) XMPP Extensions, , http://xmpp.org/extensions/; Hildebrand, J., Millard, P., Eatmon, R., Saint-Andre, P., (2008) XEP-0030: Service Discovery, , http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html; Saint-Andre, P., (2004) XEP-0134: XMPP Design Guidelines, , http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0134.html; Millard, P., Saint-Andre, P., Meijer, R., (2010) XEP-0060: Publish-Subscribe, , http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html; Smack, , http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/index.jsp, Ignite Realtime; Millard, P., Saint-Andre, P., Meijer, R., Whack, , http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/whack/index.jsp; Gallagher, N., Simple XML Serialization, , http://simple.sourceforge.net/; Hildebrand, J., Saint-Andre, P., Tronçon, R., Konieczny, J., (2008) Entity Capabilities, , http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html; Saint-Andre, P., (2012) XEP-0114: Jabber Component Protocol, , http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html";"Gonçalves, J.M.; PT Inovação e Sistemas, Universidade de AveiroPortugal";;"IEEE Communications Society;IEEE Computer Society";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;19th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications, ISCC 2014;23 June 2014 through 26 June 2014;;108094;15301346;9,78148E+12;;;English;Proc.

Therefore, attracting third-party developers and facilitating application development is crucial. Platform boundary resources enable third-party developers to create the applications. Thus, the platform boundary resources expose and extend the platform architecture. We conducted an industrial case study on third-party developer experience, particularly on the role of platform boundary resources in exposing the platform architecture and facilitating development. The studied ecosystem is centered on managing end-users' content across devices, the ecosystem was in its pre-commercial phase. The results identify the platform boundary resources in the case study and propose a model for classifying the resources. Further, designing the platform boundary resources is not only about opening up the platform architecture. Instead, the platform boundary resources need to account for a rich variety of applications, or at least not limit too much the creativity of third-party developers, while still aiming at the ease of development.

This also leads to new opportunities and challenges regarding new business models, open innovation, collaborative development, strategic planning, and coordination of multiple platforms. IWSECO and WEA aim to further increase the body of knowledge in software ecosystems by providing a forum to exchange ideas and discuss the most recent innovations, trends and experiences in the field. It aims to build and shape the community of leading practitioners and research experts by providing a forum for the exchange of research results and industrial practice in software ecosystems. By co-locating both, IWSECO and WEA we aim at attracting and involving interested participants from the larger European software engineering community in an early stage of shaping software ecosystem research and community building. The co-located workshops will be a venue for practitioners and researchers to share experience and lessons learned; with a particular focus on architecture, as the ecosystem architecture can actually determine the success or failure of software ecosystems as a whole. © 2014 Authors.";;"Industrial research; Knowledge management; Software architecture; Collaborative development; Community buildings; Engineering community; Industrial practices; Management challenges; Multiple platforms; New business models; Software ecosystems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;;;;University of Vienna;Association for Computing Machinery;8th European Conference on Software Architecture Workshops, ECSAW 2014;25 August 2014 through 29 August 2014;Vienna;107540;;9,78145E+12;;;English;ACM Int.

We used a case study approach in which we first identified characteristics of scalability from the research literature and then examined ecosystems to determine the extent to which their primary architectures possessed these characteristics. We also examined the architectures of the platform extensions. We found that each architecture exhibited those characteristics although through different mechanisms and to different degrees. © 2014 IEEE.;"Platform; Scalability; Software Architectures; Software Ecosystems";"Research; Scalability; Software architecture; Case study approach; Different mechanisms; Platform; Software ecosystems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Amorim, S.D.S., De Almeida, E.S., McGregor, J.D., Extensibility in ecosystem architectures: An initial study (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 International Workshop on Ecosystem Architectures, 19, pp. 11-15. , August Saint Petersburg Russia; Weinstock, C.B., Goodenough, J., On system scalability (2006) Software Engineering Institute, CMU/SEI-2006-TN-012, , March; Geels, F.W., From sectoral systems of innovation to socio-Technical systems: Insights about dynamics and change from sociology and institutional theory (2004) Research Policy, 33 (6-7), pp. 897-920. , issue September; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., Strategy as ecology (2004) Harvard Business Review, 82 (3), pp. 68-78. , March; Feiler, P.H., Sullivan, K., Wallnau, K.C., Gabriel, R.P., Goodenough, J.B., Linger, R.C., Longstaff, T.A., Schmidt, D., Ultra-Large-Scale Systems: The software challenge of the future (2006) Software Engineering Institute, , June; Hadoop, , http://hadoop.apache.org/7Eclipse; How quality attributes of software alatform architectures influence software ecosystems (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 International Workshop on Ecosystem Architectures, 19, pp. 6-10. , http://oodt.apache.org/, Apache OODT August Saint Petersburg Russia; Bondi, A.B., Characteristics of scalability and their impact on performance (2000) Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Software and Performance, pp. 195-203. , September 17-20 Ottawa, Canada; Cataldo, M., Herbsleb, J.D., Architecting in software ecosystems: Interface translucence as an enabler for scalable collaboration (2010) Proceedings of the Fourth European Conference on Software Architecture, Companion Volume, pp. 65-72. , August 23-26; Azad Bolour, , http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Plug-inarchitecture/ plugin_architecture.html; The Chromium Projects, , http://www.chromium.org/developers/designdocuments/multi-process- Architecture; The Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/sustainablebusiness/leadership-future- diversity-creativity-cocreation, accessed 10/5/2013; A Framework for Software Product Line Practice, Version 5.0, , http://www.sei.cmu.edu/productlines/frame_report/productLS.htm; Styger, E., (2012) Eclipse Editor Scalability, , http://eclipse.dzone.com/articles/eclipse-editor-scalability, August; Mattmann, C.A., Crichton, D.J., Medvidovic, N., Hughes, S., A software architecture-based framework for highly distributed and data intensive scientific applications (2006) Proceeding of the 28th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 721-730. , May 20-28 Shanghai, China; Mattmann, C.A., (2012) Big Data Challenges at NASA, , http://www.slideshare.net/Hadoop_Summit/big-data-challenges-At-nasa, June; Mattmann, C.A., (2007) Software Connectors for Highly Distributed and Voluminous Data-Intensive Systems, , Ph.

Scientific software is produced in a larger environment of collaboration that includes not only software developers, but also scientists who both use and extend the software for their research endeavors. The objective of this research is to understand the factors that promote and inhibit ecosystem formation and sustainment specific to scientific research software development. We have identified a set of relevant problems inhibiting sustainability in the scientific software context, including development, evolution and maintenance, as well as funding and leadership. We have collected data and used existing business, software, and innovation analysis techniques to examine the artifacts from several scientific research projects. We interviewed significant actors in select scientific ecosystems. We describe the differences between scientific software ecosystems and commercial software ecosystems, our initial results from interviews and data analysis, and we provide a set of recommendations and approaches towards handling software sustainability. Data suggests an ecosystem strategy can contribute to the survivability and sustainability of research software; however, such a strategy, which may distract from sustainability, requires thought and effort be given to establishing and nurturing the ecosystem, which in turn distract from the research mission. At this stage these initial results point us to future potentially fruitful investigations. © 2014 ACM.";"D.2.8 [Software Engineering]: Software Ecosystems; Science of Science Policy; Scientific Software; Software Sustainability";"Ecosystems; Software architecture; Software testing; Sustainable development; Commercial software; Innovation analysis; Science policies; Science research; Scientific researches; Scientific softwares; Software developer; Software ecosystems; Software design";;;;;;;"Brown, J., Knepley, M., Smith, B., (2013) Run-time Extensibility: Anything Less Is Unsustainable, , http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.791571, Technical Report 791571, WSSSPE1; Carver, J.C., Thiruvathukal, G.K., (2013) Software Engineering Need Not Be Difficult, , http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.830442, Technical Report 830442, WSSSPE1; Chastek, G., McGregor, J.D., It takes an ecosystem Systems and Software Technology Conference (SSTC 2012), April 2012; Chue Hong, N., Hole, B., Moore, S., (2013) Software Papers: Improving the Reusability and Sustainability of Scientific Software, , http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.795303, Technical Report 795303, WSSSPE1; (2014) Eclipse Science Working Group Charter, , http://science.eclipse.org/charter, May; Ferenbaugh, C.R., (2013) Experiments in Sustainable Software Practices for Future Architectures, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1428, Technical Report 1309.1428, WSSSPE1; Greene, M., The demise of the lone author (2007) Nature, 450 (7173), pp. 1165-1165; Hanwell, M., Perera, A., Turner, W., O'Leary, P., Osterdahl, K., Hoffman, B., Schroeder, W., (2013) Sustainable Software Ecosystems for Open Science, , http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.790756, Technical Report 790756, WSSSPE1; Humphrey, W., Dalke, A., Schulten, K., VMD: Visual molecular dynamics (1996) Journal of Molecular Graphics, 14 (1), pp. 33-38. , DOI 10.1016/0263-7855(96)00018-5; Joppa, L.N., McInerny, G., Harper, R., Salido, L., Takeda, K., O'Hara, K., Gavaghan, D., Emmott, S., Troubling trends in scientific software use (2013) Science, 340 (6134), pp. 814-815; Katz, D.S., (2013) Citation and Attribution of Digital Products: Social and Technological Concerns, , http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.791606, Technical Report 791606, WSSSPE1; Koop, D., Freire, J., Silva, C.T., (2013) Enabling Reproducible Science with VisTrails, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1784, Technical Report 1309.1784, WSSSPE1; Marsden, A., (2014) Interview with Alison Marsden, , Email exchange, May; Milinkovich, M., (2014) Interview with Mike Milinkovich, , Email exchange, June; Monteith, J.Y., McGregor, J.D., A three viewpoint model for software ecosystems Proceedings of 16th IASTED International Conference on Software Engineering and Applications (SEA '12), 2012; Norris, B., Software architecture issues in scientific component development (2006) Applied Parallel Computing.

This value gains more and more importance when embedded into the digital ecosystem of a Smart City, where several aspects must be considered: logistics, economy, tourism, entertainment and so on. This work presents a project, developed within DATABENC (a High Technology District for Cultural Heritage Management recently funded by Regione Campania) that aims at designing and developing a system based on a Service Oriented Architecture providing a set of context-aware applications for assisting users (e.g. Tourists, citizens, etc.) in the exploration and management of Single Smart Spaces (e.g. Indoor museum, archaeological site, historical archive, etc.). In particular, we propose several techniques for designing context aware applications by tailoring useful data and services in a given environment. In particular, a Slow Intelligence System approach is adopted for the tailoring of the services and contents. A case study for a real single smart space and some preliminary experimental results are presented and discussed. © 2014 IEEE.;"context-aware and pervasive system; Cultural heritage applications; service oriented architecture";"Computer architecture; Information services; Internet; Ubiquitous computing; Archaeological site; Context aware applications; Cultural heritage application; Cultural heritages; Digital ecosystem; Historical archive; Intelligence systems; Pervasive systems; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Archeology; Data Processing; Ecosystems; History; Information Retrieval";;;;;;;"Alemdar, H., Ersoy, C., Wireless sensor networks for healthcare: A survey (2010) Computer Networks, 54 (15), pp. 2688-2710; Armbrust, M., A view of cloud computing (2010) Communications of the ACM, 53 (4); Atzori, L., Iera, A., Morabito, G., The internet of things: A survey (2010) Computer Networks, 54 (15), pp. 2787-2805; Caragliu, A., Del Bo, C., Nijkamp, P., Smart cities in europe (2009) Proc. of CERS'2009-3rd Central European Conference on Regional Science, , Ko͈ice, Slovak Republic; Hernandez-Munoz, J.M., Smart cities at the forefront of the future internet (2011) Future Internet Assembly.

While keystone players use partnership models to orchestrate actors, the relationship between the type of partnership and activity has not been studied. To address this gap, we have researched the partnership model of the Eclipse Ecosystem and the activity of different types of partners. We have used Eclipse Dash and GitHub to gather data about the activity of Eclipse partners. The results show that a higher level of membership is related to more activity. However, it is also observed that non-member companies are more active than associate members, which suggests that Eclipse can and should improve their partnership model by motivating associate members and incorporating active non-member companies. In addition, other software ecosystems could use these results and implications to improve their own partnership models. © 2014 ACM.;"Associate model; Eclipse; Membership; Partner activity; Software Ecosystem";"Software architecture; Associate model; Eclipse; Membership; Partnership models; Software ecosystems; Value creation; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"(2014) About the Eclipse Foundation; (2014) Become An Eclipse Corporate Sponsor; (2014) Eclipse Dash, , http://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dash; (2014) Eclipse Membership Types; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 13th International Soft.

Lack of alignment is the root cause of many problems experienced in the software-intensive systems industry. The ESAO model provides a framework for addressing the aforementioned challenges. It provides an internal perspective as well as an ecosystem perspective and for each perspective offers a strategic, architectural and ways of working dimension. ESAO offers tools for each of the dimensions as well as mechanisms for establishing and maintaining alignment.

Open source communities and ecosystems do not follow the standard governance strategies typically used in large organizations. A meritocracy is a frequently occurring form of governance on different levels in open ecosystems. In this paper we investigate how this form of governance influences the health of projects within the Eclipse ecosystem in terms of the amount of commits within each month. We analyzed the hierarchy of Eclipse, how merits are conceptualized within the ecosystem and the effect of the appointments of mentors and project leads on the amount of commits. From our research, we can conclude that this system is not always as fair as it seems; merits are only a benefit in some cases. © 2014 ACM.";"Ecosystem Health; Meritocracy; Open Source; Software Ecosystems";"Open source software; Open systems; Software architecture; Ecosystem health; Integrated development environment; Large organizations; Meritocracy; Open source communities; Open sources; Software ecosystems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Aarnoutse, M., Renes, C., Snijders, R., Loyalty and Migration of Contributors in Software Ecosystems (2014) Proceedings on Workshop Software Ecosystems, , Utrecht University; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., Strategy as ecology (2004) Harvard Business Review, 82 (3), pp. 68-81; Jansen, S., (2013) Measuring the Health of Open Source Software Ecosystems: Moving Beyond the Scope of Project Health; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems (2009) Software Engineering-companion Volume, 2009, pp. 187-190. , icse-companion 2009. 31st international conference on; Kim, A.J., (2000) Community Building on the Web: Secret Strategies for Successful Online Communities, , Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc; O'Mahony, S., Ferraro, F., The emergence of governance in an open source community (2007) Academy of Management Journal, 50 (5), pp. 1079-1106; Scacchi, W., (2003) Free/open Source Software Development Practices in the Computer Game Community";;;University of Vienna;Association for Computing Machinery;8th European Conference on Software Architecture Workshops, ECSAW 2014;25 August 2014 through 29 August 2014;Vienna;107540;;9,78145E+12;;;English;ACM Int.

One of the reasons for this can be extensive supplier and subcontractor relationships and the cost, effort or unpredictability of the deliverables from the subcontractors are experienced as a major problem the paper proposes open software ecosystem as an alternative approach to develop software for embedded systems, and elaborates on the necessary quality attributes of an embedded platform underlying such an ecosystem the paper then defines a reference architecture consisting of 17 key decisions together with four architectural patterns, and provides the rationale why they are essential for an open software ecosystem platform for embedded systems in general and automotive systems in particular the reference architecture is validated through a prototypical platform implementation in an industrial setting, providing a deeper understanding of how the architecture could be realised in the automotive domain. Four potential existing platforms, all targeted at the embedded domain (Android, OKL4, AUTOSAR and Robocop), are evaluated against the identified quality attributes to see how they could serve as a basis for an open software ecosystem platform with the conclusion that while none of them is a perfect fit they all have fundamental mechanisms necessary for an open software ecosystem approach. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.;"Embedded software; Software architecture; Software ecosystem";"Contractors; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Software architecture; Architectural pattern; Fundamental mechanisms; Industrial settings; Platform implementations; Quality attributes; Reference architecture; Software ecosystems; Strategic opportunity; Ecosystems";;;;;;This work has been financially supported by the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA) and Volvo Car Corporation within the partnership for Strategic Vehicle Research and Innovation (FFI).;"Agrawal, M., Chari, K., Software effort, quality, and cycle time: A study of CMM level 5 projects (2007) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 33, pp. 145-156. , 10.1109/TSE.2007.29; Ameller, D., Ayala, C., Cabot, J., Franch, X., How do software architects consider non-functional requirements: An exploratory study (2012) IEEE Proceedings of the Requirements Engineering Conference, pp. 41-50. , Chicago, IL, USA 10.1109/RE.2012.6345838; Autosar, (2008) Technical Overview v2.2.2, , http://www.autosar.org/download/R3.1/AUTOSAR_TechnicalOverview.pdf; Babar, M.A., Dingsøyr, T., Lago, P., (2009) Software Architecture Knowledge Management: Theory and Practice, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-02374-3, 1st ed.

Usually, an engineer targets a particular platform which needs considerable time and manpower for process of design and development. The proposed architecture can be applied almost exclusively to the FPGAs, using a soft processor core to perform basic software functions as well as the main role of digital signal processing. The memory map to other logic modules and external peripherals as well as a boot-loader for loading the software image have been designed. A FIFO based component interface has been designed to maintain communication between modules and external devices as well as a data logger module for debug purposes. Since the entire hardware-software ecosystem is built on a single FPGA using Register Transfer Level (RTL) coding, it can freely be used on any FPGA family by any FPGA vendor with minor modifications. This allows us to build powerful SDR systems even using basic FPGA kits, an RF-frontend and an Analog-to-Digital (ADC) module. A survey of open source processor cores is conducted to estimate resource usage and complexity on an FPGA. This can be used to select an FPGA and a processor core such that the entire system can run on a single FPGA. This architecture is implemented on an existing SDR platform and all features are successfully validated on the hardware. Data logged from this system while running a sample signal processing implementation, was tested in Matlab and was shown to have correct time and frequency domain signals at various points in the signal processing chain. © 2014 IEEE.;;"Digital signal processing; Hardware; Logic devices; MATLAB; Open source software; Component interfaces; Design and Development; Hardware and software architectures; Proposed architectures; Register transfer level; Soft processor cores; Software-defined radios; Time and frequency domains; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)";;;;;;;"Reinhart, R., Johnson, S., Kacpura, T., Hall, C., Smith, C., Liebetreu, J., Open architecture standard for nasa's software-defined space telecommunications radio systems (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE, 95 (10), pp. 1986-1993; Reinhart, R., Scardelletti, M., Mortensen, D., Kacpura, T., Andro, M., Smith, C., Liebetreu, J., Farrington, A., Hardware architecture study for nasa's space software defined radios (2006) Wireless and Microwave Technology Conference, 2006.

Biological metaphors of living adaptable ecosystems provide the logical foundation for self-optimizing and self-healing run-time environments for intelligent adaptable business services and related information systems with service-oriented enterprise architectures. The present research in progress work investigates mechanisms for adaptable enterprise architectures for the development of service-oriented ecosystems with integrated technologies like Semantic Technologies, Web Services, Cloud Computing and Big Data Management. With a large and diverse set of ecosystem services with different owners, our scenario of service-based SmartLife ecosystems can pose challenges in their development, and more importantly, for maintenance and software evolution. Our research explores the use of knowledge modeling using ontologies and flexible metamodels for adaptable enterprise architectures to support program comprehension for software engineers during maintenance and evolution tasks of service-based applications. Our previous reference enterprise architecture model ESARC - Enterprise Services Architecture Reference Cube - and the Open Group SOA Ontology was extended to support agile semantic analysis, program comprehension and software evolution for a SmartLife applications scenario. The Semantic Browser is a semantic search tool that was developed to provide knowledge-enhanced investigation capabilities for service-oriented applications and their architectures. © 2014 IEEE.;"Adaptive Enterprise Reference Architecture;

Whether it is an explicit, managed ecosystem or the implicit ecosystem of collaborators, competitors, and users that surrounds any organization, the community of organizations has momentum in a particular direction. When a system of systems is composed using systems from each of several ecosystems the differences in communities can prevent satisfactory integration. We examine the case of a portion of the infrastructure needed to support automated driving. We use Maier's criteria that identify challenges for systems of systems as starting points for investigations into differences among ecosystems. We found points of commonality that tie together the ecosystems include use of common standards, membership by large organizations in multiple ecosystems, and influences of the outside business environment. We also found points of variation including whether the systems have compatible real-time expectations, terms of licenses, frequency of new releases, and architectural assumptions. Developers of a system of systems benefit from being aware of the similarities and differences among the ecosystems from which their systems originate because both the similarities and differences help developers anticipate the evolutionary trajectories of the individual systems. © 2014 ACM.;"software ecosystem; system of systems";"Real time systems; Software architecture; Systems engineering; Automated driving; Business environments; Individual systems; Large organizations; Software ecosystems; Software systems; System of systems; Systems of systems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Baldwin, C.Y., (2012) Organization Design for Distributed Innovation; Eclipse Roadmap V5, , http://www.eclipse.org/org/councils/roadmap_v5_0/; http://www.locationtech.org/, Eclipse Foundation; (2011) Systems Engineering Handbook, , http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/products/sehandbook.aspx; (2000) Joint Vision 2020, , http://www.dtic.mil/jointvision/jvpub2.htm, Joint Chiefs of Staff.

While such integration can be relatively straightforward for a single instance - that is, the integration of a specific knowledge resource in a specific clinical information system - the challenge lies in the fact that both knowledge resources and clinical information systems are quite diverse. Consequently, there is no single knowledge integration architecture that can address all circumstances. However, there are several architectural patterns for knowledge integration that can, taken together, enable the effective integration of knowledge resources into applications. The primary purpose of this chapter, then, is to outline the main CDS knowledge integration architectures that are available and to detail the pros and cons of each approach. The appropriateness of a given architecture for a particular organization depends on a variety of factors, including the existing clinical information system infrastructure and the type of CDS capability involved (e.g. real-time vs. non-real-time applications. These various approaches are outlined here, with special attention being placed on knowledge integration architectures aligned with broad trends in the IT landscape, such as service-oriented architectures, cloud-based computing, and app-based software ecosystems. The chapter also discusses how CDS architectures must align with larger changes in the health care industry as a whole, as shifting health care reimbursement models are requiring continuity of care across multiple organizations and health IT systems centered around patients and populations rather than care episodes at individual care settings. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

NERC for Supporting Software of Enterprise Internet Service, Kingdee, Shenzhen, China";Big data poses big challenges to modern enterprises. Traditional data-intensive business applications begin to fall behind the times, because of insufficient capabilities to process large data volumes, ever-changing streaming data and unstructured information. Furthermore, large, complex and all-in-one enterprise applications are no longer popular, whereas lightweight and fragmentary applications become welcome for the sake of the bursts of cloud computing and mobile internet. Below this kind of situation, this paper proposed a big data application platform for enterprises to simply develop and operate personalized data retrieval, data analysis, business intelligence and other data-intensive services. Unlike current related products, it is distinguished for the design of key-value based hybrid data storage and a service-oriented outsourcing architecture. The former is used to resolve the frequently-encountered issue of diversified and massive data storage, and the latter enables an open environment for third-party vendors, which promotes a self-increasing services ecosystem for big data application development. In order to validate the feasibility of our platform, the paper also developed a sentiment analysis application for Kingdee popular products based on the services provided by the platform. The result of our experiment proves that the platform shows enough potential to effectively facilitate data-intensive application development. © 2014 IEEE.;"application platform; big data; business intellgence; key-value store";"Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Information analysis; Outsourcing; Product design; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Application platforms; Big data applications; Business applications; Data-intensive application; Data-intensive services; Enterprise applications; Key-value stores; Third party vendors; Big data";;;;;;;"Evelson, B., Norman, N., Topic overview business intelligence (2008) Forrester Research; (2011) Big Data in the Enterprise: Network Design Considerations, , http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/white-paper-c11-690561.pdf, Cisco; Zikopoulos, P., Eaton, C., (2011) Understanding Big Data: Analytics for Enterprise Class Hadoop and Streaming Data, , McGraw-Hill Osborne Media; Lee, R., (2004) Scalability Report on Triple Store Applications, , http://simile.mit.edu/reports/stores; Leavitt, N., Will nosql databases live up to their promise (2010) IEEE Computer, 43 (2), pp. 12-14; Blumberg, R., Atre, S., The problem with unstructured data (2003) DM Review, 13 (2), pp. 42-49; Strauch, C., (2011) NoSQL Databases, , http://www.christofstrauch.de/nosqldbs.pdf; Chang, F., Dean, J., Ghemawat, S., Bigtable: A distributed storage system for structured data (2008) ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS, 26 (2), pp. 1-14; Khetrapal, A., Ganesh, V., (2006) HBase and Hypertable for Large Scale Distributed Storage Systems, , Department of Computer Science Purdue University; http://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-And-policy/supervisoryreporting/implementing-technical-standard-on-supervisoryreporting-data-point-model-/-/regulatory-Activity/consultation-paper; Fielding, R.T., (2000) Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-Based Software Architectures, , University of California; Mukherjee, S., Bhattacharyya, P., Feature specific sentiment analysis for product reviews (2012) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics (CICLing 2012), New Delhi, India, March 11-17, pp. 475-487; http://club.kingdee.com; http://weibo.com; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Newman, D., Asuncion, A., Smyth, P., Welling, M., Distributed algorithms for topic models (2009) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 10, pp. 1801-1828; http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/14/big-data-App-platformcontinuuity-raises-10m-from-battery-Andreessen-horowitz-Andothers; http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/bigdata; http://www.lucidworks.com; http://www.informationweek.com/big-data/big-data-Analytics/16-top-big-data-Analytics-platforms/d/d-id/1113609";"Hu, B.; 1.

DEs are clusters of distributed and diverse digital components, which interact with each other in a self-organising, scalable, and sustainable manner. This could be viewed similar to the interaction of living organisms in a biological ecosystem. The DE concept has traditionally found widespread use in the business environments. However, the concept can well be applied to the home environment, giving rise to the concept of Digital Habitat Ecosystem (DHE). Thus a DHE refers to a cluster of devices for measurement, control, and sensing of environment parameter with the help of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The primary incentive behind this chapter is to show how the DHE concept can be used for maximising the utilisation of vital resources, such as water and electricity, in the home environment and leading to a more sustainable living. Furthermore, the work outlined in this chapter proposes Digital Habitat Ecosystem Architecture (DHEA), which integrates the various digital elements of a home network in a holistic manner. However, there are some current digital system architectures such as Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) available these days; this chapter discusses the shortcomings of the SOA architecture and how the proposed DHEA will rectify the same. In addition, this chapter gives an overview of the static web based model of the home management system, how dynamic DHE varies from those existing models. © 2014, IGI Global.";;;;;;;;;"(2011) Water consumption per person., , ABS Water Account, Australia, 1993-94 to 1996-97, 2000-01, 2004-05 (cat. no. 4610.0); ABS Australian Historical Population Statistics, 2008 (cat. no. 3105.0.65.001); Brancheau, J., (2009) Smart grid ecosystem- Fasten your seat belts, , http://EzineArticles.com/?expert=James_Brancheau, Ezine articles.

Cloud computing is highly scalable and provides virtualized resources as a subscription to users. Use of clouds in education provides great opportunity for students to improve achieved learning outcomes, and learners can gain significant advantages in the new learning environment. Cloud adaption can also help to significantly reduce cost of infrastructure, software and human resources. In this article service oriented cloud computing architecture is used to transfer E-learning into the cloud.

Primarily, software ecosystem modeling, one of the most studied areas in the software ecosystem domain, is an emerging field. However, modeling software ecosystems present several challenges: (a) How can value chains be identified in an ecosystem? (b) What are the typical roles that an actor plays in an ecosystem? (c) How can a boundary in an ecosystem be described? To capture the ecosystem of the Dutch software industry, we performed forty-two case studies. This work enhanced the software supply network diagram to define the proposed diagrams of an ecosystem within this industry. We determined eight value chain models that can be used to identify typical roles that an actor plays in an ecosystem. We observed that most, if not all software producing organizations are hybrid companies in that they fill multiple roles in the value chains. The resulting models enable ones to identify actors and their roles quickly in an ecosystem. Moreover, they facilitate further understanding of the elemental business models and value chains. As such, this work provides an elementary step towards a software ecosystem modeling language. © 2013 ACM.;"software ecosystem; software ecosystem modeling; software industry; software supply network";"Business models; Elementary steps; Modeling softwares; Software ecosystems; Software industry; Software supply networks; Value chain model; Value chains; Chains; Software engineering; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Basole, R.C., Karla, J., On the evolution of mobile platform ecosystem structure and strategy (2011) Business & Information Systems Engineering, 3 (5), pp. 313-322; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 13th International Software Product Line Conference, pp. 111-119. , Carnegie Mellon University; Bosch, J., Bosch-Sijtsema, P., From integration to composition: On the impact of software product lines, global development and ecosystems (2010) Journal of Systems and Software, 83 (1), pp. 67-76; Boucharas, V., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Formalizing software ecosystem modeling (2009) Proc of the 1st Intl Workshop on Open Component Ecosystems, pp. 41-50. , ACM; Brinkkemper, S., Soest, I., Jansen, S., Modeling of product software businesses: Investigation into industry product & channel typologies (2009) Information Systems Development, pp. 307-325; Burkard, C., Draisbach, T., Widjaja, T., Buxmann, P., (2011) Software Ecosystems: Vendor-sided Characteristics of Online Marketplaces, , Informatik; Cusumano, M., (2004) The Business of Software: What Every Mgr, Progr, & Entrepreneur Must Know to Thrive & Survive in Good Times & Bad, , Free press; Handoyo, E., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Software ecosystem roles classification (2013) Software Business.

Trying to expand a product into a platform on which components, services and applications can be created, a company may provide the basis for an ecosystem and its life cycle. In this paper, we describe the evolution process of an application towards an ecosystem using current models and taking into account the reuse of an existing software system. The application DiaDia has been developed for smartphones and its main function consists in helping the treatment of diabetic patients. Two different models are used to discuss the transition of the application to an ecosystem: one is an adaptation of the Software Supply Network which represents the main actors that interact with the ecosystem, and the other covers the process of creating an application and its evolution to an ecosystem through Business Process Model and Notation. © 2013 ACM.;"ecosystems modeling; mobile applications; software ecosystems; software life cycle; software reuse";"Business process model; Exploratory studies; Mobile applications; Services and applications; Software ecosystems; Software life cycles; Software platforms; Software supply networks; Application programs; Computer software reusability; Life cycle; Patient treatment; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Anvaari, M., Jansen, S., Evaluating Architectural Openness in Mobile Software Platforms (2010) Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Software Architecture, 2nd IWSECO, Copenhagen, Denmark, pp. 85-92; Barbosa, O.A.L.P., Santos, R.P., Alves, C.F., Werner, C.M.L., Jansen, S., A Systematic Mapping Study on Software Ecosystems from a Three-Dimensional Perspective (2013) Software Ecosystems: Analyzing and Managing Business Networks in the Software Industry, pp. 59-81. , Jansen, S.; Brinkkemper, S.; Cusumano, M.A. (Org.). 1ed.

It is executed by hardware and interacts with its environment. So-called software systems are complicated hierarchical systems. They are carefully engineered by competent engineers. In contrast, complex systems, like biological ecosystems, railway systems and the Internet itself, have never been developed and tested as a whole by a team of engineers. Nevertheless, those complex systems have the ability to evolve without explicit control by anyone, and they are more robust to dealing with problems at the level of their constituent elements than classical engineered systems. Consequently, in this article we introduce the concept of complex software ecosystems comprised of interacting adaptive software systems and human beings. Ecosystems achieve the demanded flexibility and dependability by means of a kind of higher-level regulatory system. Their equilibrium is continuously preserved through the appropriate balance between the self-adaptation and the self-control capabilities of an ecosystem's participants. We will outline a methodology to support the engineering of ecosystems by integrating a model- and constraint-based engineering approach and applying it during design- and runtime. The open-world semantics of constraints establish a framework for the behavior of the participants and the ecosystem itself. Violations of constraints can be identified during design time, but also provide knowledge transfer to runtime. Constraints are additionally monitored and enforced during runtime. Thus, we propose an evolutionary engineering approach covering the whole life-cycle for forever active complex software ecosystems. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

For the provision of information services in display technology rich settings we draw the analogy to biological ecosystems as a community of living organisms together with nonliving components of the environment, linked together through information flows, and by that acting as a global system. We identify individuals in the information society with their situational information demands and their implicit and explicit interaction styles as the living, and the plethora of display devices as the non-living part of an information ecosystem. A local interactions oriented service architecture is developed, the SAPERE pervasive service substrate. A situation aware social feedback mechanism is proposed and implemented in the SAPERE architecture, demonstrating how incentivizing local interactions can stand as a principle to attain desirable global information balance. © 2013 IEEE.;"Awareness architectures; Display systems; Information ecosystems; Multisensor recognition; Pervasive service architectures";"Biological ecosystem; Display system; Display technologies; Global informations; Information ecosystems; Multi sensor; Pervasive service; Service architecture; Biology; Cybernetics; Display devices; Ecosystems; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA)";;;;;;;"Gollan, F., Wally, B., Ferscha, A., Automatic attention estimation in an interactive system based on behaviour analysis (2011) Proceedings of the 15th Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Pears, N., Jackson, D., Olivier, P., Smart phone interaction with registered displays (2009) IEEE Pervasive Computing, 8 (2), pp. 14-21; Ojala, T., Kukka, H., Linden, T., Heikkinen, T., Jurmu, M., Hosio, S., Kruger, F., Ubi-hotspot 1.0: Large-scale long-term deployment of interactive public displays in a city center (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 Fifth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services, pp. 285-294. , IEEE Computer Society; Vogel, D., Balakrishnan, R., Interactive public ambient displays: Transitioning from implicit to explicit, public to personal, interaction with multiple users (2004) Proceedings of the 17th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, pp. 137-146. , New York, NY, USA: ACM; Koppel, M.T., Bailly, G., Muller, J., Walter, R., Chained displays: Configurations of public displays can be used to influence actor-, audience-, and passer-by behavior (2012) Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 317-326. , New York, NY, USA: ACM; Muller, J., Wilmsmann, D., Exeler, J., Buzeck, M., Schmidt, A., Jay, T., Kruger, A., Display blindness: The effect of expectations on attention towards digital signage (2009) Pervasive Computing, pp. 1-8. , ser.

These languages cover many concepts ranging from individual services and their code generation from specifications, service semantics, service compositions and networks, economics and business aspects around service ecosystems etc. However, this abundance of specification languages has also resulted in communication difficulties between stakeholders and hinders tasks such as service composition, discovery and maintenance. The presented work is a step towards the unification of the specifications and different aspects of service systems using Model-Driven Engineering. We propose a generic and abstract web service meta-model called WSMeta, which has the ability to describe both operation-centric web services (WS-*) and data-centric web services (REST) and can be used in tasks such as service evolution analysis and service systems maintenance.

Although within the same enterprise, each business unit has individual motivations and participation interests. For coordinating development, the emerging discipline of software ecosystems intents to explicitly discover and analyze the different players' interests, and manage them, often by means of a suitable software architecture. Already within a single enterprise, this discipline can be of high value. Instead of detailed managerial orders to coordinate internal interactions, an analysis of the players, their interests, and a suitable software architecture may slacken organizational structures and simplify processes. We have started to analyze the ecosystems of several Siemens internal product-lines in order to determine the different players and their interests, and to derive suitable software architectural requirements from this setting. This will enable us to compare these requirements to the actual architecture, for identifying reusable pain points and best practices of the existing system. However, there is no systematic (A) approach to model and analyze the collaboration among the participants from a technical perspective, as well as (B) to derive reusable architectural design-patterns and anti-patterns from such software ecosystems. By illustrating these problems using an existing software productline that moves towards a software ecosystem, we are looking for answers to the two questions above to evaluate whether our product-lines are fit for a future as internal software ecosystems. © 2013 IEEE.;;"Best practices; Business units; Existing systems; Industrial software; Large enterprise; Organizational structures; Software architectural; Software ecosystems; Computer software reusability; Industry; Software architecture; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) Proc. of the 13th Int.

However, only little research has been reported on early-stage design of software ecosystems (SECOs) for software service platforms, in particular in the collective intelligence (CI) domain. In this work we analyze needs for CI-centered SECOs leading to new research challenges. We have identified self-organization and feedback mechanisms as essential characteristics in CI-centered SECOs and thus introduce design elements for structuring them properly at an early stage of design. We discuss the concept with a real-world use case from a widely used CI-centered SECO, Wikipedia. A major result is the successful mapping of the design elements to the specific SECO elements.;"Collective intelligence; Human computation; Software architecture; Software ecosystems; Stigmergic information system";"Collective intelligences; Design of softwares; Essential characteristic; Feedback mechanisms; Human computation; Research challenges; Social media services; Software ecosystems; Design; Software architecture; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Ahn, L.V., (2005) Human Computation, , PhD thesis, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Dec; Bedau, M.A., Humphreys, P., (2007) Emergence: Contemporary Readings in Philosophy and Science, , MIT Press; Bonabeau, E., Dorigo, M., Theraulaz, G., (1999) Swarm Intelligence: From Natural to Artificial Systems, , Oxford University Press; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) Proc. of the 13th Int'l Software Product Line Conference (SPLC '09), pp. 111-119. , Carnegie Mellon University; Bosch, J., Bosch-Sijtsema, P., From integration to composition: On the impact of software product lines, global development and ecosystems (2010) Journal of Systems and Software, 83 (1), pp. 67-76. , Jan; Brun, Y., Serugendo, G., Gacek, C., Giese, H., Kienle, H., Litoiu, M., Müller, H., Shaw, M., Engineering self-adaptive systems through feedback loops (2009) Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems, pp. 48-70. , Springer; Chesbrough, H., (2011) Open Service Innovation, , Jossey-Bass; Gawer, A., Cusumano, M., (2002) Platform Leadership: How Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco Drive Industry Innovation, , Harvard Business School Press; Hanssen, G.K., Dyba, T., Theoretical foundations of software ecosystems (2012) Proc. of the 4th Int'l Workshop on Software Ecosystems (IWSECO '12), pp. 6-17. , CEUR-WS; Heylighen, F., Collective intelligence and its implementation on the web: Algorithms to develop a collective mental map (1999) Computational & Mathematical Organization Theory, 5 (3), pp. 253-280. , Oct; Howe, J., (2006) Crowdsourcing: A Definition, , http://www.crowdsourcing.com/cs/2006/06/crowdsourcinga.html, (last visited 05/08/2013); Jansen, S., Cusumano, M., Defining software ecosystems: A survey of software platforms and business network governance (2012) Proc. of the 4th Int'l Workshop on Software Ecosystems (IWSECO '12), pp. 41-58. , CEUR-WS; Katz, M.L., Shapiro, C., Network externalities, competition, and compatibility (1985) The American Economic Review, 75 (3), pp. 424-440; Kittlaus, H.-B., Clough, P.N., (2009) Software Product Management and Pricing: Key Success Factors for Software Organizations, , Springer; Malone, T.W., Laubacher, R., Dellarocas, C., Harnessing crowds: Mapping the genome of collective intelligence (2009) Working Paper No. 2009-001, MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, , Feb; Musil, J., Musil, A., Winkler, D., Biffl, S., A first account on stigmergic information systems and their impact on platform development (2012) Proc. of the WICSA/ECSA 2012 Companion Volume (WICSA/ECSA '12), pp. 69-73. , ACM; Quinn, A.J., Bederson, B.B., Human computation: A survey and taxonomy of a growing field (2011) Proc. of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '11), pp. 1403-1412. , ACM; Van Dyke Parunak, H., A survey of environments and mechanisms for human-human stigmergy (2006) Proc. of the 2nd Int'l Conference on Environments for Multi-Agent Systems (E4MAS '05), (2005), pp. 163-186. , Springer-Verlag; Van Steen, M., (2010) Graph Theory and Complex Networks: An Introduction, , Maarten von Steen";Christian Doppler Laboratory for Software Engineering Integration for Flexible Automation Systems, Institute of Software Technology and Interactive Systems, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria;;ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT);;2013 1st International Workshop on Software Ecosystem Architectures, WEA 2013;19 August 2013 through 19 August 2013;Saint Petersburg;99151;;9,78145E+12;;;English;Int.

Generally, they use software platforms and extend them, joining an ever growing software ecosystem surrounding the platform. In this paper, the relationships between architecture and platform adoption are explored by analyzing the results of interviews and document study of five case studies of platform extenders. It is found that platform architecture plays a minor role in platform adoption by platform extenders, but that quality attributes strongly influence an architect's design choices when extending a platform. The findings of this work can be used by platform developers to improve platform extendibility and usability.;"Platform architecture; Software ecosystems; Software platforms";"Commercial applications; Platform architecture; Quality attributes; Software ecosystems; Software platforms; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Jacobson, I., Griss, M., Jonsson, P., (1997) Software Reuse: Architecture, Process and Organization for Business Success, , ACM Press, NY, USA; Frakes, W.B., Kang, K., Software reuse research: Status and future (2005) Trans. of Soft.

These services with their compositions produced by consumers form a service ecosystem. However as time goes by, some of the services are no longer available or says perishing due to the competition among the ecosystem. Obviously, compositions invoking these perishing services are also becoming unavailable. Thus, choosing the services which are more stable can help the consumers to product more valuable composition. The goal of this paper is to find a way to separate the potential perishing services in the ecosystem so that we can give suggestions to service consumers and help them develop more durable and valuable compositions. Firstly, we study the competition relation between services by their user tags and establish a service-service competition network. Based on the network analysis, we extract the common feature of perishing services and formalize this feature as percentage ranking (PR) of services. Finally, we propose a classification algorithm to predict potential perishing services. With the good performance in recall and precision rate, our algorithm is credible for identifying potential perishing services thus we can suggest the consumers to select more durable services for their compositions. © 2013 IEEE.;"binary classification; complex network analysis; service competition; service user tags";"Binary classification; Classification algorithm; Common features; Durable service; Recall and precision; Service consumers; Service ecosystems; User tags; Algorithms; Complex networks; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Web services; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Benslimane, D., Dustdar, S., Sheth, A., Services mashups: The new generation of web applications (2008) Internet Computing, IEEE, 12, pp. 13-15. , 01-01 2008; Caimei, L., Xiaohua, H., Jung-Ran, P., Exploiting the social tagging network for web clustering (2011) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Part A: Systems and Humans, 41, pp. 840-852. , 01-01 2011; Nagarajan, M., Verma, K., Sheth, A.P., Miller, J., Lathem, J., Semantic interoperability of web services-challenges and experiences (2006) IEEE International Conference on Web Services, pp. 373-382; Lara, R., Roman, D., Polleres, A., Fensel, D., A conceptual comparison of wsmo and owl-s (2004) Web Services, pp. 254-269; Hui, W., Zhiyong, F., Yang, S., Shizhan, C., Service network: An infrastructure of web services (2009) IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems, pp. 303-308; Wei, T., Jia, Z., Foster, I., Network analysis of scientific workflows: A gateway to reuse (2010) Computer, 43, pp. 54-61. , 2010-01-01; Xuanzhe, L., Yi, H., Wei, S., Haiqi, L., Towards service composition based on mashup (2007) IEEE Congress on Services, 2007, pp. 332-339; Su, L.T., The relevance of recall and precision in user evaluation (1994) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 45, pp. 207-217. , 1994-01-01; Lu, F., Lijie, W., Meng, L., Junfeng, Z., Yanzhen, Z., Lingshuang, S., Towards automatic tagging for web services (2012) IEEE 19th International Conference on Web Services, pp. 528-535; Ning, D., He, K., Peng, R., Liu, J., A multi-dimensional social tagging method for semantic web services (2011) IEEE International Conference on Services Computing, pp. 735-736; Zhaoyun, D., Deng, L., Jia, Y., Zhou, B., An, L., A web service discovery method based on tag (2010) International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems, pp. 404-408; Chukmol, U., Benharkat, A.N., Amghar, Y., Enhancing web service discovery by using collaborative tagging system (2008) 4th International Conference on Next Generation Web Services Practices, pp. 54-59; Romsaiyud, W., Premchaiswadi, W., Applying mining fuzzy sequential patterns technique to predict the leadership in social networks (2012) 9th International Conference on ICT and Knowledge Engineering, pp. 134-137; Leskovec, J.K.A.C.J., Graphs over time densification laws, shrinking dimaeters and possible explanations (2005) Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery in Data Mining, pp. 177-178; Sienkiewicz, J., Holyst, J.A., (2005) Statistical Analysis of 22 Public Transport Networks in Poland; Keman, H., Yushun, F., Wei, T., An empirical study of programmable web: A network analysis on a service-mashup system (2012) IEEE 19th International Conference on Web Services (ICWS2012), pp. 552-559; Barros, A.P., Dumas, M., The rise of web service ecosystems (2006) IT Professional, 8, pp. 31-37. , 2006-01-01";Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China;;"IBM Greater China Group;Tsinghua University;Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT);IBM";;2013 International Conference on Service Science, ICSS 2013;11 April 2013 through 13 April 2013;Shenzhen;98697;21653836;9,78077E+12;;;English;Proc.

Bucci 41C, Rende, Italy";The Competence Center ICT-SUD is carrying out an industrial research program, co-financed by the Calabria Region, aimed at building a digital ecosystem with some of its associate organizations for boosting technology transfer services. In particular, the program focuses on analysis, design, implementation and test of an innovative digital ecosystem architecture to effectively support complex business organizations involved in software applications development and distribution as well as service delivery. The digital ecosystem is meant to improve their production and organization processes, to increase their innovation levels and to reinforce their competitiveness, by enabling them to create business and social networks with partners, customers and research centers using the digital ecosystem. The first two steps of the program concern: (1) the analysis and specification of the innovation needs and requirements of the ICT-SUD's industrial partners involved in the program, and (2) the set-up of a cooperative platform for enabling advanced social network features and knowledge discovery on the digital ecosystem. The paper presents some preliminary results of the above two steps. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

However, not many studies have been conducted to assess the architectural decision-making and decision reuse processes through empirical investigations. Besides, the effect of the relationships among the actors in a software ecosystem on the architectural decisions-making process of each actor is not well studied. Goal: The objective of this paper is to identify the main processes and issues on the architectural decision-making in largescale enterprises by considering the relationships among the enterprises and other actors of the ecosystem. Method: We conducted semi-structured interviews with six Norwegian companies in the software ecosystem of electricity industry. Results: Regarding the architectural decision-making process, the findings are in line with previous empirical studies, showing that most of the companies are not using well-known academic approaches such as ATAM, they are rather using their own procedures. The study also shows that the relationships among the actors of a software ecosystem could significantly affect the architectural-decision making process in each of the actors, for example, by limiting their alternative solutions. Finally, the results confirm that it is advantageous for the enterprises to reuse the architectural decisions across their various projects or for cooperative companies to reuse the decisions across their similar projects. Conclusion: Improving the reusable architectural decision frameworks by considering the relationships among the actors in a software ecosystem would be beneficial for the industry. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.;"Architectural decision making; electricity industry; empirical study; enterprise applications; software ecosystem";"Architectural decision makings; Electricity industry; Empirical studies; Enterprise applications; Software ecosystems; Application programs; Decision making; Ecosystems; Electric industry; Software architecture; Computer software reusability";;;;;;;"Babar, M.A., Dingsøyr, T., Lago, P., Van Vliet, H., (2009) Software Architecture Knowledge Management, , Springer; Brinkkemper, S., Soest, I.V., Jansen, S., Modeling of Product Software Businesses: Investigation into Industry Product and Channel Typologies (2009) Information Systems Development: Challenges in Practice, Theory, and Education, 1, pp. 307-325. , Barry, C., et al.

The Pilarcos open service ecosystem architecture provides an environment where inter-enterprise collaborations can be collectively managed, utilizing correctness and acceptability criteria set in ecosystem-wide dynamic processes. The correctness requirements are defined in terms of business network models, policies and service definitions that are dynamically utilized as complex conformance reference points. Failures to conform to these reference points trigger pre-committed recovery behavior. The ODP reference model provides sufficient and efficient facilities for the design of this kind of complex, adaptive system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.;"Inter-enterprise collaboration environment; Interoperability; ODP reference model; Service ecosystem; Service-oriented computing and software production";"Business networks; Dynamic process; Inter-enterprise collaboration; Open services; Reference models; Reference points; Service definition; Service ecosystems; Software production; Adaptive systems; Industry; Interoperability; Models; Ecosystems";;;;;Helsingin Yliopisto;This work is part of my research group activities (cinco.cs.helsinki.fi) at the Department of Computer science at the University of Helsinki.;"Kutvonen, L., Ruokolainen, T., Ruohomaa, S., Metso, J., Service-oriented middleware for managing inter-enterprise collaborations (2008) Global Implications of Modern Enterprise Information Systems: Technologies and Applications, Advances in Enterprise Information Systems (AEIS), IGI Global, pp. 209-241; Kutvonen, L., Metso, J., Ruohomaa, S., From trading to eCommunity management: Responding to social and contractual challenges (2007) Information Systems Frontiers (ISF) - Special Issue on Enterprise Services Computing: Evolution and Challenges, 9 (23), pp. 181-194; (2010) ITU-T Rec.

Examples are the SECOs surrounding Eclipse or Android. Due to independent release cycles of the multiple vendors for platform and extensions, SECOs are evolving frequently. This makes it hard to get a concise impression of the structure of a SECO and its variable artifacts during a given period of time. We contribute a metamodel to capture the variability in an arbitrary SECO and its evolution based on the notion of real time. We further present a procedure to create temporal perspectives on the SECO. Additionally, we provide means to analyze evolution of variability in between explicit releases of the platform, e.g., in accordance with the different release cycles of individual extensions. We demonstrate feasibility of our approach by modeling a part of the Eclipse SECO over a period of three years. © 2013 ACM.;"analysis; evolution; software ecosystem (SECO); software product line (SPL); technical ecosystem modeling notation (Tecmo); temporal perspective; variability";"analysis; Ecosystem modeling; evolution; Software ecosystems; Software product lines; temporal perspective; variability; Computer software; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Bosch, J., From Software Product Lines to Software Ecosystems Proceedings of the 13th International Software Product Line Conference, SPLC, 2009; Boucharas, V., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Formalizing Software Ecosystem Modeling Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Open Component Ecosystems, 2009; Brummermann, H., Keunecke, M., Schmid, K., Formalizing Distributed Evolution of Variability in Information System Ecosystems Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems, VaMoS, 2012; Dhungana, D., Seichter, D., Botterweck, G., Rabiser, R., Grünbacher, P., Benavides, D., Galindo, J., Configuration of Multi Product Lines by Bridging Heterogeneous Variability Modeling Approaches Proceedings of the 15th International Software Product Line Conference, SPLC, 2011; Goeminne, M., Mens, T., A Framework for Analysing and Visualising Open Source Software Ecosystems Proceedings of IWPSE-EVOL, 2010; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A Sense of Community: A Research Agenda for Software Ecosystems 31st International Conference on Software Engineering, ICSE, 2009; Lungu, M., Robbes, R., Lanza, M., Recovering Inter-project Dependencies in Software Ecosystems Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, 2010; McGregor, J., Ecosystems, Continued (2009) Journal of Object Technology; Michlmayr, M., Hunt, F., Probert, D., Release Management in Free Software Projects: Practices and Problems (2007) Open Source Development, Adoption and Innovation, pp. 295-300; Mitschke, R., Eichberg, M., Supporting the Evolution of Software Product Lines ECMDA Traceability Workshop, ECMA-TW, 2008; Robbes, R., Lungu, M., A Study of Ripple Effects in Software Ecosystems: (NIER track) 33rd International Conference on Software Engineering, ICSE, 2011; Rosenmuller, M., Siegmund, N., Automating the Configuration of Multi Software Product Lines Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems, VaMoS, 2010";"Seidl, C.; Technische Universität Dresden, Software Technology Group, 01062 Dresden, Germany; email: christoph.seidl@tu-dresden.de";;"National Research Council of Italy;Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione (ISTI)-CNR;University of Hildesheim;Universite Nice Sophia Antipolis";;7th International Workshop on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems, VaMoS 2013;23 January 2013 through 25 January 2013;Pisa;95592;;9,78145E+12;;;English;ACM Int.

It provides opportunity for service providers to offer various value added services to customers. NFC technology allows the usage of wide range of applications and eliminates the obligation to carry additional components other than the mobile device such as credit or payment cards, tickets, identification cards or keys. Despite its technological advantages over alternative ones, the NFC business ecosystems and services are yet to take off. The problems mainly arise with the business issues triggered by different and mostly conflicting needs of many actors in the ecosystem and several additional technical issues. In this study, by adopting a role-based service ecosystem modeling, we propose an NFC ecosystem model which perfectly specifies the roles in the ecosystem, and defines set of activities for each role, and communication structure. We analyzed NFC ecosystem in three phases as pre-installation, installation, and service usage. We have defined the activities and communication structure in the first two phases, and finally investigated the service usage phase in three different operating modes of NFC. After giving the details of the proposed ecosystem model, two use cases are given to validate the developed ecosystem model. We complete our study by discussing the requirement satisfaction. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.;"Near Field Communication; NFC applications; NFC ecosystem; Service providers; Trusted service manager";"Communication structures; Identification cards; Near field communications; NFC ecosystems; Service managers; Service provider; Short-range wireless communications; Value added service; Communication systems; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Assa Abloy, A.B., (2008) 'Best NFC Service of 2008' Awarded to VingCard.

Unfortunately, inadequate modeling guidelines exist currently for creating theoretical and visual models of software ecosystems, hampering advancements in this area. Even though, many different tools are available, these do not provide pointers and guidelines for performing correct and insightful modeling of software ecosystems. The aim of this PhD project is to create a modeling framework, consisting of tools, guidelines, and foundations for modeling software ecosystems. With such a framework, software ecosystem researchers, policy makers, and strategic managers of software producing organizations will gain insight into their ecosystems quicker and with higher fidelity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.;"Business modeling; Modeling; Open source; Role classifications; Software ecosystems";"Models; Open source software; Open systems; Systems engineering; Business modeling; Model framework; Modeling guidelines; Modeling softwares; Open sources; Policy makers; Software ecosystems; Visual model; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Barbosa, O., Alves, C., A systematic mapping study on software ecosystems (2011) Proc of IWSECO, , In; Boucharas, V., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Formalizing software ecosystem modeling (2009) Proc. of the 1st int'l Workshop on Open Component Ecosystems, pp. 41-50. , In:,.

Approaches in Service-Oriented Architectures are allowing new ways for users and developers to manage, control and benefit from the services that are being made available. However, this also introduces new threats for service ecosystems and with wider deployment comes a greater need to identify and tackle threats before they become attacks. In this paper we introduce a new Threat Monitoring approach based on filtering and pattern-detection of a variety of event types. The approach enables threat monitoring across multiple composite services with a capability to integrate dynamic changes from various subsystems and offers high flexibility through the use of CEP (Complex Event Processing). Appropriate events are identified in the context of Service-Oriented Architectures and the Threat Monitoring Module described and implemented as part of the Aniketos platform. This module is able to pull threat descriptions from a repository and apply appropriate detection techniques at run-time in order to identify potential problems. The approach is novel in both its flexibility and applicability. Threats can be chosen by service developers from a community-managed repository and the process extends to both the identification and prediction of threats. The solution is evaluated through a future telecommunication services case study. © 2013 IEEE.;"complex event processing; monitoring; network security; security; security patterns; service composition; SOA; threats";"Information services; Internet; Monitoring; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Telecommunication services; Complex event processing; security; Security patterns; Service compositions; SOA; threats; Network security";;;;;;;"Ghezzi, C., Guinea, S., Run-time monitoring in service oriented architectures (2007) Test and Analysis of Web Services, , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Pessoa, R.M., Silva, E., Sinderen, M.V., Quartel, D.A.C., Pires, L.F., Enterprise interoperability with s o a:A survey of service composition approaches (2008) 1 2th Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops (EDOCW, pp. 235-251. , USA; Shirey, R., (2007) Internet Security Glossary, Version 2 (RFC4949; Stoneburner, G., Goguen, A., Feringa, A., Risk management guide for information technology systems recommendations of the national institute of standards and technology (2002) NIST Special Publication, 800 (30), p. 55. , http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/SOO-30/spSOO-30.pdf; Meland, P.H., Guerenabarrena, J.B., Llewellyn-Jones, D., The challenges of secure and trustworthy service composition in the future internet (2011) Proc. of the 20 1 1 6th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering, , Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA-June 27-30; Secure and Trustworthy Composite Services, , http://www.aniketos.eu; Moser, O., Rosenberg, F., Dustdar, S., Event driven monitoring for service composition infrastructures (2010) The 1 1 Th International Conference on Web Information System Engineering (WISE' 1 0; Etzion, O., Niblett, P., Event processing in action (2010) Manning Publications, , August; Chandy, K., Schulte, W., (2010) Event Processing-Designing IT Systems for Agile Companies, , McGraw Hill Professional, New York; (2012) Deliverable 04. 3: Algorithms for Responding to Changes and Threats, , http://www.aniketos.eu/contentldeliverables; (2011) Deliverable D4. 1: Methods and Design for the Response to Changes and Threats, , http://www.aniketos.eu/contentldeliverables; http://www.jboss.org/drools/droolsexpert; http://www.jboss.org/drools/droolsfusion.html; http://www.shields-project.eu; http://www.serenity-project.org/Workpackage-6-4.html; Dey, A.K., Abowd, G.D., Towards a better understanding of context and context-awareness (2000) CHI 2000 Workshop on the What, Who, Where, When, and How of Context-Awareness, , The Hague, April; Mulo, E., Monitoring web service event trails for business compliance (2009) IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA, pp. 1-5; Thullner, R., Rozsnyai, S., Schiefer, J., Obweger, H., Suntinger, M., Proactive business process compliance monitoring with event-based systems (2011) 1 5th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops (EDOCW, pp. 429-437; McGregor, C., Kumaran, S., Business process monitoring using web services in b2b e-commerce (2002) International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium., (IPDPS, pp. 219-226; Muehlen, M.Z., Rosemann, M., Workflow-based process monitoring and controlling-technical and organizational issues (2000) 3 3 Rd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2, p. 10; Specht, S.M., Lee, R.B., Distributed denial of service:Taxonomies of attacks, tools, and countermeasures (2004) Proc.

As service scientists, our ultimate goal should be to develop and provide a science-based approach to the dynamic, scalable, secure, and knowledge-driven design and development of service ecosystems, while in the process fostering the development of academic researchers and industry professionals to work in diverse, interdisciplinary teams for engineering adaptable solutions to distributed computing problems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.;"Cloud services; Service level agreements; Service science; Service systems; Service-oriented architecture; Software-as-a-service";;;;;;;;"Bhargava, H.K., Krishnan, R., Muller, R., Decision support on demand: emerging electronic markets for decision technologies (1997) Decis Support Syst, 19, pp. 193-214; Bitner, M.J., Brown, S., The evolution and discovery of services science in business schools (2006) Commun ACM, 49, pp. 73-78; Carr, N., The end of corporate computing (2005) MIT Sloan Manage Rev, 46, p. 3; Chesbrough, H., Spohrer, J., A research manifesto for services science (2006) Commun ACM, 49, pp. 35-38; Demirkan, H., The servitisation of processes, architectures and technologies.

Nevertheless, without suitable mechanisms, paradigms and tools, this ecosystem is at risk of tending towards chaos. Indeed the take off of FI passes through the introduction of paradigms and tools permitting to establish some discipline. Choreography specifications and Governance are two different proposals which can contribute to such a vision, by permitting to define rules and functioning agreements both at the technical level and at the social (among organizations) level. In this paper we discuss such aspects and introduce a policy framework so to support a FI ecosystem in which V&V activities are controlled and perpetually run so to contribute to the quality and trustworthiness perceived by all the involved stakeholders. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.;"On-line testing; Ranking; Reputation; Service choreography; Service oriented architecture; SOA governance; V&V Policies";"Ecosystems; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); World Wide Web; On-line testing; Ranking; Reputation; Service choreographies; SOA governance; Public policy";;;;;;;"Pan, J., Paul, S., Jain, R., A survey of the research on future internet architectures (2011) IEEE Communications Magazine, 49, pp. 26-36; Fiedler, M., Gavras, A., Papanikolaou, N., Schaffers, H., Wainwright, N., (2011) FIA Research Roadmap - Towards Framework 8: Research Priorities for the Future Internet, , Technical report, The Future Internet Assembly Working Group; Barker, A., Walton, C.D., Robertson, D., Choreographing web services (2009) IEEE T.

These challenges require analyzing the field of SE from another perspective. In this sense, the study of software ecosystems (SECOs) is an emerging discipline that investigates the relationships among companies in the software industry. Companies work cooperatively and competitively in order to achieve their strategic objectives. They must engage in a new perspective, now also including third parties motivations and movements in the ecosystem, besides their own business viewpoint. Inspired on properties of natural and business ecosystems, SECO covers technical and business aspects of software development as well as partnership among companies. In this paper, we undertake a review on SECOs status as an emerging research topic in SE community. We map what is currently known about SECOs and also analyze them in a three-dimensional perspective in SE, i.e., technical, business and social. We observed that SECOs research is concentrated in eight main areas in which the most relevant ones are open source software, ecosystem modeling, and business issues. This paper also contributes to summarize the body of knowledge and presents a research agenda in SECOs. © 2012 IEEE.;"Global software development; Open source software component-based development; Social networks; Software ecosystems; Software reuse; Value-based software engineering";"Component-Based Development; Global software development; Social Networks; Software ecosystems; Value-based; Computer software reusability; Industry; Research; Social sciences computing; Software design; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Arndt, J.M., Dibbern, J., Co-innovation in a service oriented strategic network (2006) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Services Computing, pp. 285-288. , Chicago, USA; Barbosa, O., Alves, C., A systematic mapping study on software ecosystems (2011) Proc. of the 3nd IWSECO, 2nd ICSOB, pp. 15-26. , Brussels, Belgium; Barbosa, O., Santos, R., Alves, C., Werner, C., Jansen, S., A systematic mapping study on software ecosystems through a threedimensional perspective Software Ecosystems: Analyzing and Managing Business Networks in the Software Industry, , Slinger Jansen, Michael Cusumano, & Sjaak Brinkkemper (Eds.), Cheltenham, UK and Northampton, MA, USA: Edward Elgar Publishing (in press); Basili, V., Shull, F., Lanubile, F., Building knowledge through families of experiments (1999) IEEE Transactions on SE, 25 (4), pp. 456-473; Biffl, S., (2006) Value-Based Software Engineering, p. 388. , Berlin: Springer- Verlag; Boehm, B., A view of 20th and 21st century software engineering (2006) Proc. of the 28th ICSE, pp. 12-29. , Shanghai, China; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystem (2009) Proc. of 13th SPLC, pp. 1-10. , San Francisco, USA; Bosch, J., Bosch-Sijtsema, P., From integration to composition: On the impact of software product lines, global development and ecosystems (2010) The Journal of Systems and Software, 83 (1), pp. 67-76; Campbell, P., Ahmed, F., A three-dimensional view of software ecosystems (2010) Proc. of the 4th ECSA, 2nd IWSECO, pp. 81-84. , Copenhagen, Denmark; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., Strategy as ecology (2004) Harvard Business Review, 82 (3), pp. 68-78. , March; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems (2009) Proc. of the 31st ICSE, pp. 187-190. , Vancouver, Canada; Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Finkelstein, A., Business network management as a survival strategy: A tale of two software ecosystems (2009) Proc. of the 1st IWSECO, 11th ICSR, pp. 34-48. , Falls Church, USA; Messerschmitt, D., Szyperski, C., (2003) Software Ecosystem: Understanding An Indispensable Technology and Industry, , MIT Press; Moore, J.F., Predators and prey: A new ecology of competition (1993) Harvard Business Review, 71 (3), pp. 75-86. , May/June; Moore, J.F., (1996) The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems, , Harper Business; Pinto, A., Almeida, A.C.M., Morais, E., Collaborative software development process for geographically distributed teams (2009) III WDDS, XXIII SBES, pp. 89-97. , Fortaleza, Brazil; Santos, R., Werner, C., Silva, M., Brechó-VCM: A value-based approach for component markets (2010) International Transactions on Systems Science and Applications, 6 (2-3), pp. 179-199; Santos, R., Werner, C., A proposal for software ecosystems engineering (2011) 3nd IWSECO, 2nd ICSOB, pp. 40-51. , Brussels; Santos, R., Werner, C., Treating business dimension in software ecosystems (2011) 3nd ACM MEDES, pp. 197-201. , San Francisco, USA; Santos, R., Werner, C., Treating social dimension in software ecosystems through reuseecos approach (2012) Proc. of the 6th IEEE DEST, , Campione d'Italia, Italy; Stefanuto, G., Spiess, M., Alves, A.M., Castro, P., Quality in software digital ecosystems the users perceptions (2011) Proc. of the 3nd ACM/IFIP MEDES, pp. 85-88. , San Francisco, USA; Werner, C., Towards a component and service marketplace with brechó library (2009) Proc. of the IADIS International Conference WWW/Internet, pp. 567-574. , Rome, Italy";"Santos, R.; Computer Science and System Engineering Department, COPPE - Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; email: rps@cos.ufrj.br";;;;26th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering, SBES 2012;23 September 2012 through 28 September 2012;Natal;94229;;9,78077E+12;;;English;Proc. - Braz.

Many quality models exist to assess the evolvability or maintainability of software systems. Common to these models is that they, contrary to the software ecosystems they are assessing, are not evolvable or reusable. In this research, we introduce SE-EQUAM a novel ontology-based quality assessment metamodel that was designed from ground up to support model reuse and evolvability. SE-EQUAM takes advantage of Semantic Web technologies such as support for the open world assumption, incremental knowledge population, and knowledge inference. We present a case study that illustrates the reusability and evolvability of our SE-EQUAM approach. © 2012 IEEE.;"Evolution; Maintenance; Ontologies; Quality model";"Environmental factors; Evolution; Evolvability; Evolvable; Meta model; Model re-use; Ontology-based; Open world assumption; Quality assessment; Quality models; Semantic Web technology; Software ecosystems; Software systems; Ecosystems; Maintenance; Ontology; Reusability; Computer software reusability";;;;;;;"Willis, A.J., The ecosystem: An evolving concept viewed historically (1997) Funct.

At the same time, healthcare systems are stressed for resources, health centers are getting larger and more distributed, and the number of healthcare professionals does not follow the trend in chronic diseases. All of this leads to a need for telemedical and mobile health applications. In a Danish context, these applications are often developed through local (innovative) initiatives with little regards for national and global (standardization) initiatives. A reason for this discrepancy is that the software architecture for national (and global) systems and standards are hard to understand, hard to develop systems based on, and hard to deploy. To counter this, we propose a software ecosystem approach for telemedicine applications, providing a framework, Net4Care, encapsulating national/global design decisions with respect to standardization while allowing for local innovation. This paper presents an analysis of existing systems, of requirements for a software ecosystem for telemedicine, and a summary of initial design decisions for the Net4Care framework. © 2012 IEEE.;"Software architecture; Software ecosystems; Telemedicine";"Chronic disease; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Coronary disease; Design decisions; Existing systems; Health care professionals; Health centers; Health-care system; Initial design; Mission critical softwares; Mobile health application; Software ecosystems; Telemedicine application; Design; Health care; Pulmonary diseases; Software architecture; Standardization; Telemedicine; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"(2011) Nyt Fra Danmarks Statistik, , http://www.dst.dk/pukora/epub/Nyt/2011/NR205.pdf, May; (2010) Telemedicine, , http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/details/collection/806797/Telemedicine. html, August; Manikas, K., Hansen, K.M., (2012) Software Ecosystems - A Systematic Literature Review, , Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen (DIKU), Tech.

In this sense, Software Ecosystems (SECOs) have emerged as an approach to improve software reuse in global software development (GSD) industry considering relations among companies and stakeholders around the world. Companies and organizations have opened up their platforms and artifacts to others, including partners and third-part developers. This scenario changes the traditional software industry and requires mature research in software architecture, component-based software engineering and software product line (SPL) in a global market and business environment. So, GSD requires linking an architectural, a business and a social-based environment in an integrated way, as well as a focus on SECO-based management and engineering. This concern motivated a proposal of a ""3+1"" framework for SECOs management and engineering called Reuse ECOS. The approach aims at outlining a set of steps that combines those three dimensions and joins different perspectives in SECOs literature from a survey through a research strategy and a solution proposal for GSD with SECO and SPL. It was observed that SECO concepts can be merged in a broader GSD approach in SE industry. © 2012 IEEE.";"component-based development; global software development; social networks; software ecosystems; software reuse; value-based software engineering";"Component-Based Development; Global software development; Social Networks; Software ecosystems; Value-based; Computer software reusability; Ecosystems; Industry; International trade; Social sciences computing; Technical presentations; Software design";;;;;;;"Basili, V., Shull, F., Lanubile, F., Building Knowledge through Families of Experiments (1999) IEEE Trans. on SE, 25 (4), pp. 456-473; Biffl, S., (2006) Value-Based Software Engineering, p. 388. , Berlin: Springer-Verlag; Boehm, B., A View of 20th and 21st Century Software Engineering (2006) Proc. of the 28th ICSE, Shanghai, pp. 12-29; Bosch, J., From Software Product Lines to Software Ecosystem (2009) Proc. of 13th SPLC, San Francisco, USA, pp. 1-10; Bosch, J., Bosch-Sijtsema, P., From integration to composition: On the impact of software product lines, global development and ecosystems (2010) Journal of Systems and Software, 83 (1), pp. 67-76; Campbell, P., Ahmed, F., A Three-dimensional View of Software Ecosystems (2010) Proc. of the 4th ECSA, 2nd IWSECO, Copenhagen, Denmark, pp. 81-84; Hunink, I., Industry Taxonomy Engineering: The Case of the European Software Ecosystem (2010) Proc. of the 4th ECSA, 2nd IWSECO, Copenhagen, Denmark, pp. 11-118; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A Sense of Community: A Research Agenda for Software Ecosystems (2009) Proc. of the 31st ICSE, Vancouver, Canada, pp. 187-190; Malheiros, V., Seaman, C., Maldonado, J., An Approach for Collaborative and Distributed Software Process Improvement (SPI) (2009) III WDDS, XXIII SBES, Fortaleza, Brazil, pp. 21-30; Messerschmitt, D.G., Szyperski, C., (2003) Software Ecosystem: Understanding An Indispensable Technology and Industry, , The MIT Press; Pinto, A., Almeida, A.C.M., Morais, E., Collaborative Software Development Process for Geographically Distributed Teams (2009) III WDDS, XXIII SBES, Fortaleza, Brazil, pp. 89-97; Santos, R., Werner, C., Silva, M., Brechó-VCM: A Value-Based Approach for Component Markets (2010) Intern.

We propose and analyse a two-level business transaction management framework that allows injection of business level concerns to the control processes of inter-enterprise transactions. The two levels are associated with a) the metamodel of the collaboration, captured in eContract governing the collaboration, and b) the transactional interactions between collaboration member services. The two levels are bound together to form a reflective model, while business level breaches to the eContract can disturb the normal interactions, the metalevel possesses processes for managing (rolling back, compensating, ignoring, triggering ecosystem-level consequences) the failure in manners that align with the business incentives. This framework enables correctness, coherence and efficiency of processing in open inter-enterprise environments, i.e., service ecosystems. © 2012 IEEE.;"business transaction management; inter-enterprise collaboration; networked business; open service ecosystems";"Business transaction; Control process; Distributed transaction; Inter-Enterprise; Inter-enterprise collaboration; Meta model; Networked business; Open services; Service ecosystems; Technical management; Industry; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Kutvonen, L., Metso, J., Ruohomaa, S., From trading to eCommunity management: Responding to social and contractual challenges (2007) Information Systems Frontiers (ISF) - Special Issue on Enterprise Services Computing: Evolution and Challenges, 9 (2-3), pp. 181-194. , Jul; Ruokolainen, T., Kutvonen, L., Framework for managing features of open service ecosystems (2011) Handbook of Research on Non-Functional Properties for Service-Oriented Systems: Future Directions, , IGI Global, Dec. ch. 21; Ruokolainen, T., Ruohomaa, S., Kutvonen, L., Solving service ecosystem governance (2011) Proceedings of the 15th IEEE International EDOC Conference Workshops, pp. 18-25. , Helsinki, Finland: IEEE Computer Society, Aug; Kutvonen, L., ODP RM reflections on open service ecosystems (2012) Computer Standards & Interfaces, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sci.2012.01.005, in press.

A service ecosystem is a socio-technical complex system that enables servicebased collaboration between entities such as enterprises, institutions or individuals. Contemporary service ecosystems are established and managed typically in an ad hoc manner and are lacking in support for ecosystem sustainability. This paper presents the Service Ecosystem Architecture Framework which facilitates sustainability of service ecosystems by supporting activities and addressing concerns of ecosystem stakeholders. The framework provides means for design and analysis of service ecosystems. Conceptual completeness of the architecture framework is validated by modelling a modern open service ecosystem. Applicability of the architecture framework is demonstrated with respect to service ecosystem concerns. © 2012 IEEE.;"Open service ecosystems; Service ecosystem architecture framework; Service ecosystem models";"Architecture frameworks; Business models; Design and analysis; Ecosystem sustainability; Open services; Service ecosystems; Service-based; Sociotechnical; Industry; Sustainable development; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Ruokolainen, T., (2009) Modelling Framework for Interoperability Management in Collaborative Computing Environments, , Licentiate thesis, University of Helsinki, Department of Computer Science; Ruokolainen, T., Kutvonen, L., (2011) Handbook of Research on Non-Functional Properties for Service-Oriented Systems: Future Directions, , IGI Global, Dec. ch. 21: Framework for managing features of open service ecosystems; Ruokolainen, T., Ruohomaa, S., Kutvonen, L., Solving service ecosystem governance (2011) Proceedings of the 15th IEEE International EDOC Conference Workshops, pp. 18-25. , Helsinki, Finland: IEEE Computer Society, Aug; (2011) ISO/IEC FDIS 42010 - Architecture Description, , ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7/WG42, Mar., final ed.

DEs are clusters of distributed and diverse digital components, which interact with each other in a self-organising, scalable, and sustainable manner. This could be viewed similar to the interaction of living organisms in a biological ecosystem. The DE concept has traditionally found widespread use in the business environments. However, the concept can well be applied to the home environment, giving rise to the concept of Digital Habitat Ecosystem (DHE). Thus a DHE refers to a cluster of devices for measurement, control, and sensing of environment parameter with the help of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The primary incentive behind this chapter is to show how the DHE concept can be used for maximising the utilisation of vital resources, such as water and electricity, in the home environment and leading to a more sustainable living. Furthermore, the work outlined in this chapter proposes Digital Habitat Ecosystem Architecture (DHEA), which integrates the various digital elements of a home network in a holistic manner. However, there are some current digital system architectures such as Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) available these days; this chapter discusses the shortcomings of the SOA architecture and how the proposed DHEA will rectify the same. In addition, this chapter gives an overview of the static web based model of the home management system, how dynamic DHE varies from those existing models. © 2013, IGI Global.";;;;;;;;;"(2011) Water consumption per person, , ABS Water Account, Australia, 1993-94 to 1996-97, 2000-01, 2004-05 (cat. no. 4610.0); ABS Australian Historical Population Statistics, 2008 (cat. no. 3105.0.65.001); Brancheau, J., Smart grid ecosystem- Fasten your seat belts (2009) Ezine Articles, , http://EzineArticles.com/?expert=James_Bran-cheau, Retrieved from; Chang, E., West, M., (2006) Digital Ecosystems a Next Generation of the Collaborative Environment; Chetty, M., Tran, D., Grinter, R.E., (2008) Getting to Green: Understanding Resource Consumption in the Home; Dini, P., Rathbone, N., Vidal, M., Hernandez, P., Ferronato, P., Briscoe, G., (2005) The Digital Ecosystems Research Vision: 2010 and Beyond, pp. 1-326. , http://www.digitalecosystems.org/events/2005.05/de_posi-tion_paper_vf.pdf, Retrieved from; Eklund, P., Wray, T., Ducrou, J., Web services and digital ecosystem support using formal concept analysis (2009) Proceedings of the International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems, p. 8; Elisa, I., Smart metering: A significant component of water conservation (2006) Paper Presented at the IWA / AWA 1st Young Water Professionals Conference, , http://www.ourwater.vic.gov.au/programs/victorian-water-trust/publi-cations/smart-water-metering-cost-benefit-study, Retrieved from; (2009), http://www.ewater.com.au/, eWater Tool kit, Retrieved on 20 May, 2011, from; Ferronato, P., Ecosystem oriented architecture (EOA) vs. SOA (2007) Digital Ecosystem Technology, pp. 108-155. , European Commission, Information Society and Media; Gorton, J., (2010) Australia's Water, , http://www.environment.gov.au/water/index.html, Retrieved 20 May, 2011, from; Guo, A.Z.Y., Zeman, A., Li, R., Utility simulation tool for automated energy demand side management (2010) Agent Technology for Energy Systems, 6, p. 8; Hayes, B., Cloud computing-As software migrates from local PCs to distant Internet servers, users and developers alike go along for the ride (2008) Communications of the ACM, 51 (7), pp. 9-11. , doi:10.1145/1364782.1364786; Kambil, A., What is your Web 5.0 strategy?

A Digital Ecosystem (DE) is an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) system, which includes an open and a loosely coupled network of self-organizing ICT nodes and links. Advances in DE technology, an emerging research area, promise new approaches for controlling, monitoring, and managing the use and reuse of resources in built environments. However, the use of DE technology is currently limited to application in business enterprise networks as Open Source Environment (OSE). There are many network communication challenges because of this OSE i.e. advanced smart home devices are open source devices which can communicate via Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), and are facing some networking traffic delays. Many research and development challenges exist, and must be addressed before this technology can be scaled to, and applied in built environments. The objective of this paper is to describe the hierarchy model of the smart home environment using a DE concept, and explain how the smart home devices communicate according to their node set up. © 2012 IEEE.;"Digital Ecosystem; Digital Habitat Ecosystem; Multimedia; Network Protocols; Object Oriented model; Sensor Networks; Sustainability; Web-based Architecture; Wireless Communication";"Digital ecosystem; Multimedia; Object oriented model; Web-based architecture; Wireless communications; Automation; Information technology; Intelligent buildings; Network architecture; Network protocols; Research; Sensor networks; Sustainable development; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Dong, H., Ontology-based digital ecosystem conceptual representation (2007) Presented at the Third International Conference on Autonomic and Autonomous Systems (ICAS'07); Pillai, K., King, H., Ozansoy, C., Sharda, N., Methodology and framework to construct and integrate digital habitat ecosystem architecture (2012) International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Research (IJICTR), pp. 276-284; Pillai, K., Ozansoy, C., (2012) Web Based Digital Habitat Ecosystem for A Book.

We believe that recommendations made across these different platforms by exploiting the synergies between them will benefit learners. However, building such cross-platform recommender systems poses new and unique challenges for developers. In this paper, we present a framework to support the development of cross-platform recommender systems for TEL ecosystems and discuss challenges faced. The framework decouples the development of the recommender system from the evolution of the specific platforms by combining graph-based algorithms, a unified data model, and a service oriented architecture. As proof of concept, the framework was effectively applied to develop a cross-platform recommender system in a TEL ecosystem having Moodle as the Learning Management System, Mahara as the Social Networking Service and Ariadne as Learning Object Repository.;"Cross-platform; Framework; Recommender systems; TEL";"Cross-platform; Framework; Graph-based algorithms; Learning management system; Learning object repositories; Social networking services; Technology enhanced learning; TEL; Ecosystems; Graphic methods; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Recommender systems";;;;;;;"Beham, G., Kump, B., Ley, T., Lindstaedt, S., Recommending knowledgeable people in a work-integrated learning system (2010) Procedia Computer Science; Boley, H., Chang, E., Digital, ecosystems: Principles and semantic (2007) Inaugural IEEE Int.

A DE is also a scalable distributed network of nodes where data can move freely between its nodes and trusted interpreters can access, edit or use these data for a range of purposes, e.g. to control the utilisation of available resources. The advancement of the DE technology, an emerging research area, promises new approaches for controlling, monitoring, and managing the use and reuse of resources in built-up environments. However, the use of the DE technology is currently most widely utilised in business enterprise networks, and many research and development challenges exist and must be addressed before this technology can be scaled to and applied in built up environments. The main objective in this research is therefore to investigate and build a Digital Habitat Ecosystem Architecture (DHEA) that can integrate all the existing smart devices available in the home environment. Furthermore, it will monitor and control the use of the vital resources (water, electricity) in built up environments. The specific objective of this proposed research is to address the shortcomings of the wireless communication networks and to standardize the devices into the common standards. This paper aims to outline the significance of DHEA, the core DHEA devices, and the Element and Section-based model of a DHEA research project. © 2012 IEEE.;"Digital Ecosystem; Digital Habitat Ecosystem; Sensor Networks; Web-based Architecture; Wireless Communication";"Business enterprise network; Common standards; Coupled networks; Digital ecosystem; Distributed networks; Home environment; Information and Communication Technologies; Monitor and control; Nodes and links; Research and development; Self-organising; Smart devices; Web-based architecture; Wireless communication network; Wireless communications; Digital devices; Information technology; Network architecture; Research; Sensor networks; Telecommunication networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Nachira, F., Towards a network of digital ecosystems: Which technology,which research?

Model driven development (MDD) and model driven architecture (MDA) techniques for describing inter-project dependencies are rarely used or they're not updated by anyone during software evolution process. Describing the dependencies by hand can be painful and error prone process. Another solution is recovering the dependencies using some reverse-engineering process. There are some existing technologies today. One of them is an Ecco model of inter-project dependencies with a set of methods for recovering the dependencies from Smalltalk based software ecosystems developed by Lungu et al. Aim of our research is applying this model with its methods on Java based software ecosystem.;"Inter-Project Dependencies; Java; Model Driven Development; Reverse Engineering; Software Ecosystems";"Error-prone process; Inter-Project Dependencies; Java; Java software; Model driven architectures; Model driven development; Smalltalk; Software ecosystems; Software Evolution; Computer software; Legacy systems; Reverse engineering; Software architecture; Specifications; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"(2002) Maven Project, , Apache; Lungu, M., (2009) Reverse Engineering Software Ecosystems, , PhD thesis, University of Lugano; Lungu, M., Lanza, M., Girba, T., Heeck, R., Reverse engineering super- repositories (2007) Proceedings of the 14th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering, pp. 120-129. , (Washington, DC, USA), IEEE Computer Society; Lungu, M., Robbes, R., Lanza, M., Recovering inter-project dependencies in software ecosystems (2010) Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, pp. 309-312. , (New York, NY, USA), ASE '10, ACM.

Handling data volumes in excess of peta-scale are no longer restricted to few narrow application areas. Computing platforms ecosystem has also advanced with virtualization based and cloud oriented platforms emerging as most disruptive ones. Unique characteristics of such platforms have important implications for how the architecture of business applications is designed - particularly the ability to achieve certain non-functional requirements. In this paper we first bring out properties of the said computing platforms that are architecturally significant from business applications' view point. We then bring out implications that such properties have for software design and architecture. We demonstrate the use of this knowledge about platform properties by devising a novel architectural design pattern ""Platform Level Aspect-Orientation"" which can be used to address a variety of application scenarios. © 2012 IEEE.";"Cloud Computing; Design Patterns; Non-functional Requirements; Quality Attributes; Software Architecture Design; Virtualization";"Design Patterns; Non-functional requirements; Quality attributes; Software architecture design; Virtualizations; Architectural design; Cloud computing; Computer systems; Data handling; Virtual reality; Software architecture";;;;;;;"Rimal, B., Jukan, A., Katsaros, D., Goeleven, Y., Architectural requirements for cloud computing systems: An enterprise cloud approach (2011) Journal of Grid Computing, pp. 1-24; Youseff, L., Butrico, M., Da Silva, D., Toward a unified ontology of cloud computing (2008) Grid Computing Environments Workshop, 2008.

Although such platforms are very popular, their architectural concepts and underlying system dynamics are not yet fully understood. This paper uses stigmergy, a form of indirect communication and self-organization, as basis for framing certain groups of software services in order to propose an architectural concept of stigmergic information systems and describe identified key fields (actor base, architecture, software ecosystem) inuencing them. Thus enabling the creation of better solution stack configurations needed to support effective and efficient development of such services.

Telecommunications companies (or ""telcos"") use CDRs for purposes of billing, extracting business intelligence, fraud detection, etc. However, they face a Big Data challenge - many telcos get billions of CDRs per day, and are unable to keep up with these data rates. In this paper, we describe a stream processing solution for processing CDRs that allows scaling the processing to handle 6 billion CDRs per day for a certain telco. We describe the stream processing application (running on the IBM InfoSphere Streams platform) that performs CDR mediation and analysis in real-time. We also describe various business and operational constraints and the legacy software ecosystem - seldom discussed in academic gatherings - that make the problem more challenging than originally meets the eye. The outcome of our work is a highly configurable and scalable CDR processing stream with several functional and performance capabilities that are a first for the telecommunication industry.

Nevertheless, without suitable mechanisms, paradigms and tools, this ecosystem is at risk of tending towards chaos. Indeed the take off of FI passes through the introduction of paradigms and tools permitting to establish some discipline. Choreography specifications and Governance are two different proposals which can contribute to such a vision, by permitting to define rules and functioning agreements both at the technical level and at the social (among organizations) level. In this paper we discuss such aspects and introduce a policy framework so to support a FI ecosystem in which V&V activities are controlled and perpetually run so to contribute to the quality and trustworthiness perceived by all the involved stakeholders.;"On-line testing; Ranking; Reputation; Service choreography; Service Oriented architecture; SOA governance; V&V policies";"On-line testing; Ranking; Reputation; Service choreographies; SOA governance; Ecosystems; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); World Wide Web; Public policy";;;;;;;"Arroyo, S., Sicilia, M.-A., Sophie: Use case and evaluation (2008) Information & Software Technology, 50 (12), pp. 1266-1280; Baresi, L., Nitto, E.D., Ghezzi, C., Toward open-world software: Issue and challenges (2006) Computer, 39, pp. 36-43; Barker, A., Walton, C.D., Robertson, D., Choreographing web services (2009) IEEE T.

A set of necessary qualities is identified for the embedded platform enabling the ecosystem, i.e. deployability of new functions, maintainability over time, and configurability according to hardware within the product family. The embedded platform must support composability of software from different development stakeholders, such as the original equipment manufacturer, strategic and 3rd-party developers. The paper presents some key mechanisms for implementing the necessary certification in the platform that facilitates composability while still preserving dependability. A theoretical example of how this would look like in the automotive domain is presented, and an actual case of an in-vehicle platform implementing some of the mechanisms is shown.

We will show how those principles have been instantiated as a core set of techniques. These techniques, combined together, have resulted in several highly successful architecture analysis and design methods. Finally, we will show how these foundations, and the techniques that instantiate them, can be re-combined for new purposes addressing problems of ever-increasing scale, specifically: addressing the highly complex problems of analyzing software-intensive ecosystems. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Geir Hanssen presents a longitudinal case study of an emerging ecosystem. The paper raises interesting aspects of a theory of software ecosystems, including the role of a central referent organization, self-regulation, networked character as well as the importance of sharing values, control and the business and technology aspects of successful ecosystem adoption. The second paper, by Terhi Kilamo and co-authors, takes a different perspective and studies the challenge of putting software developed as closed source into the open-source domain with the intent of building a software ecosystem around it. The fourth paper, by Slinger Jansen and co-authors, raises a very important challenge to many organizations and external developers looking to determine whether to invest in a software ecosystem. The fifth paper, by Rick Kazman and co-authors, focuses on software architecture analysis and how analysis techniques can be applied to software ecosystems.;;"Analysis techniques; Closed source; Longitudinal case study; Open-source; Software ecosystems; Systems and software; Hardware; Software engineering; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 13th International Software Product Line Conference, ACM; Bosch, J., Bosch-Sijtsema, P., From integration to composition: On the impact of software product lines, global development and ecosystems (2010) Journal of Systems and Software, 83 (1), pp. 67-76; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., Strategy as ecology (2004) Harvard Business Review, 82, pp. 68-78; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering - Companion Volume, IEEE, pp. 187-190; Messerschmitt, D.G., Szyperki, C., (2005) Software Ecosystem Understanding An Indispensable Technology and Industry, , MIT, Press 0262633310; Viljainen, M., Kauppinen, M., Software ecosystems: A set of management practices for platform integrators in the telecom industry (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Business, pp. 32-43. , Springer Brussels, Belgium";"Bosch, J.; Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden; email: Jan@JanBosch.com";;;;;;;;1641212;;JSSOD;;English;J Syst Software;Article;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84861093577

Such systems are composed of components potentially under two or more licenses, open source or proprietary or both, in an architecture in which evolution can occur by evolving existing components, replacing them, or refactoring. The software licenses of the components both facilitate and constrain the system's ecosystem and its evolution, and the licenses' rights and obligations are crucial in producing an acceptable system. Consequently, software component licenses and the architectural composition of a system help to better define the software ecosystem niche in which a given system lies. Understanding and describing software ecosystem niches for open architecture systems is a key contribution of this work. An example open architecture software system that articulates different niches is employed to this end. We examine how the architecture and software component licenses of a composed system at design time, build time, and run time help determine the system's software ecosystem niche and provide insight and guidance for identifying and selecting potential evolutionary paths of system, architecture, and niches. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Examples include intelligent devices, sensors embedded in the environment and the emerging Internet-of-Things. Simultaneously users are becoming increasingly involved as information providers and consumers by means of Web 2.0 and social media. While these areas have gained a lot of attention recently and while the research on Digital Ecosystems has also dealt with these phenomena separately there seems to be need for research on the rich and complex ecosystem combining the sensor-based information sources with Web 2.0 and mobile services. In this paper, we propose a Digital Ecosystem architecture, which combines the social media and Internet-of-Things. The architecture is the fruit from the international collaboration between two long-term university Living Lab projects in Finland and in China.

Bucci 41C, Rende, Italy";The Competence Center ICT-SUD is carrying out an industrial research program, co-financed by the Calabria Region, aimed at building a digital ecosystem with some of its associate organizations for boosting technology transfer services. In particular, the program focuses on analysis, design, implementation and test of an innovative digital ecosystem architecture to effectively support complex business organizations involved in software applications development and distribution as well as service delivery. The digital ecosystem is meant to improve their production and organization processes, to increase their innovation levels and to reinforce their competitiveness, by enabling them to create business and social networks with partners, customers and research centers using the digital ecosystem. The first two steps of the program concern: (1) the analysis and specification of the innovation needs and requirements of the ICT-SUD's industrial partners involved in the program, and (2) the set-up of a cooperative platform for enabling advanced social network features and knowledge discovery on the digital ecosystem. The paper presents some preliminary results of the above two steps. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

Current consumer electronics products are built using components from a large variety of specialized firms, whereas previously each product was developed by a single, vertically integrated company. Taking a software development perspective, we analyze the transition in the consumer electronics industry using case studies from digital televisions and mobile phones. We introduce a model consisting of five industry structure types and describe the forces that govern the transition between types and we describe the consequences for software architectures. We conclude that, at this point in time, software supply chains are the dominant industry structure for developing consumer electronics products. This is because the modularization of the architecture is limited, due to the lack of industry-wide standards and because resource constrained devices require variants of supplied software that are optimized for different hardware configurations. Due to these characteristics open ecosystems have not been widely adopted. The model and forces can serve the decision making process for individual companies that consider the transition to a different type of industry structure as well as provide a framework for researchers studying the software-intensive industries. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;"Case study;

The new types of services increase the potential of some Service-Oriented Architecture concepts, e.g. dynamic discovery and composition of services. We envision a dynamic cloud-enabled service ecosystem in which different business actors cooperate in delivering scalable high-value services to the end user. The different providers should be able to discover, request, use and discard services during runtime based on some internal management logic. We define and use a reference model to explain this dynamicity, characterized by the introduction of the concept of Virtual Distributed Execution Environment (VDEE) between the virtual resources and the applications. Based on a study of the state of the art on cloud and SOA technologies, we identify functions of existing platforms that could be integrated to implement the proposed reference model. We also identify some challenges that still need to be addressed. Finally we anticipate the business-related evolution towards the dynamic cloud. © 2011 IEEE.";"business roles; cloud computing; composition; discovery; SOA; virtual distributed execution environment";"Business roles; Composition of services; discovery; Distributed execution; Dynamic discovery; End users; Reference models; Runtimes; Service ecosystems; Service Oriented; SOA; State of the art; Virtual resource; Chemical analysis; Information services; Models; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Telecommunication networks; Cloud computing";;;;;;;"AWS CloudFormation, , http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/; Brgulja, N., Manzalini, A., Minerva, R., Moiso, C., Autonomic nature-inspired eco-systems Springer Transactions on Computational Science, , in press; Böhm, M., Leimeister, S., Riedl, C., Krcmar, H., Cloud computing - Outsourcing 2.0 or a new business model for IT provisioning?

High water levels have impacted ecological conditions, in particular floating vegetated islands. Barrage operation options prioritizing hydropower, agriculture and the lake ecosystem are developed using a lake water balance model. Current hydropower abstractions can be maintained without ecologically damaging high water levels. Enhanced agricultural abstractions reduce levels to meet ecological requirements. The latter could be satisfied without compromising current hydropower and agricultural abstractions. An integrated option shows it is largely possible to balance hydropower and agricultural abstractions with wetland water-level requirements. Sustainability of barrage operation options is assessed under climate change scenarios. Higher monsoon precipitation and river flow can be accommodated. Larger dry-season drawdowns impact most barrage operation options, especially the integrated option. Results demonstrate the requirement to consider current and potential future climatic conditions when developing wetland water-level management plans. © 2011 Copyright 2011 IAHS Press.;"climate change; ecosystem service; hydrological model; hydropower; Loktak Lake, India; MIKE SHE; water balance";"ecosystem service; Hydrological models; hydropower; Loktak Lake, India; MIKE SHE; water balance; Abstracting; Agriculture; Climate models; Dams; Ecosystems; Hydroelectric power; Lakes; Water levels; Wetlands; Climate change; climate change; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem service; environmental assessment; numerical model; river flow; water budget; water level; water management; wetland; India; Loktak Lake; Manipur";;;;;NE/E001890/1, NERC, Natural Environment Research Council;;"Acreman, M.C., Meigh, J.R., Sene, K.J., Modelling the decline in water-level of Lake Toba, Indonesia (1993) Advances in Water Resources, 16, pp. 207-222; Andersen, J., Refsgaard, J.C., Jensen, K.H., Distributed hydrological modelling of the Senegal River basin-model construction and validation (2001) Journal of Hydrology, 247, pp. 200-214; Angom, D., (2005) Ecological studies of vegetation in Keibul Lamjao National Park, Manipur.

Business services have distinctive features that are not typically observed in plain Web services. The representation of business services requires that we view human activity and human-mediated functionality through the lens of computing and systems engineering. We give insights into the modeling of business services and relationships between them. This work sheds light on the analysis, design and reusability of business-aware services that business owners, entrepreneurs and business architects alike would find useful when dealing with their service ecosystem. © 2011 Lam-Son Lê.;"Business Processes; Business Services; Enterprise Architecture; Service Ecosystem; Services Evolution; SOA";"Business Process; Business service; Enterprise Architecture; Service ecosystems; Services Evolution; SOA; Ecosystems; Information services; Reusability; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Web services; Information systems";;;;;;;"Altinkemer, K., Bundling e-banking Services (2001) Communications of the ACM 44, 6, pp. 45-47; Bitner, M., Evaluating service encounters: The effects of physical surroundings and employee responses (1990) Journal of Marketing 54, 2, pp. 69-82; Booch, G., (2007) Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, , (3rd Edition): Addison-Wesley Professional, isbn 978-0201895513; Chang, S.H., Kim, S.D., A Systematic Approach to Service-Oriented Analysis and Design (2007) Proceedings of 8th International Conference on Product-Focused Software Process Improvement, pp. 374-388. , Riga, Latvia, July 2007; Gamma, E., Helm, R., Johnson, R., Vlissides, J., (1995) Design Patterns: Addison-Wesley, , isbn 0-201-63361-2; Ghose, A., A formal approach to designing and managing service ecosystems (2011) Proceedings of 19th International Conference on Information Systems Development, , Prague, Czech Republic, August 2011; Grigoriu, A., (2007) SOA or SOEA, Service Oriented Enterprise Architecture, , (White paper), Toolbox for IT; Hansmann, U., Merk, L., Nicklous, M-S., Stober, T., (2011) Pervasive Computing: The Mobile World: Springer, , isbn 978-3642055256; Homann, U., (2006) A Business-Oriented Foundation for Service Orientation, , (White paper), Microsoft MSDN Library; (2010) ITU-T X.902-ISO/IEC 10746-2 Information Technology-Open Distributed Processing-Reference Model-Foundations, , ISO/IEC., (International Standard), SC 7 and ITU; Janssen, M., Wagenaar, R., An analysis of a shared services centre in e-government (2004) Proceedings of 37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'04)-Track 5, , IEEE Computer Society, Hawaii, USA; Kloppmann, M., Koenig, D., Leymann, F., Pfau, G., Rickayzen, A., Riegen, C., Schmidt, P., Trickovic, I., (2005) WS-BPEL Extension for People-BPEL4People, , (White paper), IBM and SAP; Kohlborn, T., Fielt, E., Korthaus, A., Rosemann, M., Towards a Service Portfolio Management Framework (2009) Proceedings of 20th Australasian Conference on Information Systems, , AIS Electronic Library (AISeL), Melbourne, Australia, December 2009; Kohlborn, T., Korthaus, A., Rosemann, M., Business and Software Service Lifecycle Management (2009) Proceedings of 13th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference, pp. 87-96. , IEEE Computer Society, Auckland, New Zealand, September 2009; Lê, L-S., Dam, H.K., Ghose, A., On Business Services Representation-The 3 x 3 x 3 Approach (2010) Proceedings of 21st Australasian Conference on Information Systems, p. 58. , AIS Electronic Library (AISeL), Brisbane, Australia, December 2010; Liskov, B.H., Wing, J.M., A behavioral notion of subtyping (1994) ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, 16 (6), pp. 1811-1841; Paulson, L.D., Services Science: A New Field for Today's Economy (2006) Computer, 39 (8), pp. 18-21; Pohle, G., (2005) Component business models-Making specialization real, , (White paper), IBM® Institute for Business Value; Sarang, P., Juric, M., Mathew, B., (2006) Business Process Execution Language for Web Services BPEL and BPEL4WS, , 2nd edition: Packt Publishing, isbn 978-1904811817; Sawatani, Y., Research in service ecosystems (2007) Proceedings of Management of Engineering and Technology (PICMET'07), pp. 2763-2768. , Portland, USA; Singh, M.P., Huhns, M.N., (2005) Service-Oriented Computing: Semantics, Processes, Agents, , (1st edition): Wiley, isbn 978-0470091487; van-der-Aalst, W.M.P., Basten, T., Inheritance of Workflows-An approach to tackling problems related to change (2002) Theoretical Computer Science, 270 (1-2), pp. 125-203";"Lê, L.-S.; School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Faculty of Informatics, University of Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; email: lle@uow.edu.au";;;;22nd Australasian Conference on Information Systems, ACIS 2011;29 November 2011 through 2 December 2011;Sydney, NSW;92614;;9,78174E+12;;;English;ACIS Proc. - Aus.

The efforts to effectively introduce SOA were driven by the evermore increasing complexity and volume of information to be consumed. This paper discusses in this context some major quality characteristics of SOA systems and new measurement approaches, considering complex IT systems and digital ecosystems. This approach is based on growth models related to SOA's reference architecture as well as diversity and entropy. On a field test certain metrics are applied to a real large scale SOA system. As a result some major and important characteristics of the SOA system can be proven and weak structures in services orchestrations exposed. © 2011 IEEE.;"Complexity; Diversity; Entropy; Growth model; Measurement; Quality; SOA";"Complexity; Digital ecosystem; Diversity; Field test; Growth model; Growth models; IT system; Quality characteristic; Reference architecture; Service Oriented; SOA; Cloud computing; Entropy; Image quality; Information services; Information technology; Measurements; Software engineering; Service oriented architecture (SOA)";;;;;;;"(2011) TOGAF (the Open Group Architecture Framework) and the Available SOA Source Book, , http://www.opengroup.org/soa/sourcebook/ra/perspec.htm#_A_High- Level_Perspective, June; (2009) SOA Source Book, pp. 34-37. , The Open Group; Van Haren Publishing, ISBN: 978-0-060-92587-1; Reussner, R., Hasselbring, W., (2009) Handbuch der Software- Architektur, pp. 133-134. , dpunkt. verlag; ISBN: 978-3-898-64559-1; Masak, D., (2007) SOA? - Serviceorientierung in Business und Software, pp. 360-364. , Springer-Verlag, ISBN: 978-3-540-71871-0; Masak, D., (2009) Digitale Ökosysteme, pp. 209-241. , Springer-Verlag, ISBN: 978-3-540-79129-4; Lehman, M.M., (1997) Laws of Software Evolution Revisited, pp. 1-4. , Department of Computing, Imperial College, London, January; Lehman, M.M., Ramil, J.F., Wernick, P.D., Perry, D.E., Turski, W.M., Metrics and laws of software evolution- the nineties view (1997) Proc. of the Fourth, Intl.

This work develops a region tourism ecosystem model to simulate the importance of service cooperation among SMEs. And a novel technology called CoopeVision based on service-dominant logic (SDL) is also proposed to facilitate cooperation among SMEs to increase sustainability. In the foundation of CoopeVision technology, a platform which further integrates destination image theory, metaphor theory, and color theory is designed for SMEs to provide additional unique and attractive services to increase sustainability. We also evidence the positive effects of the adoption of the CoopeVision technology in regional tourism development through the system dynamic simulations. © 2011 IEEE.;"Destination image; Metaphor; Regional tourism; Service dominant logic; Service system";"Destination image; Metaphor; Regional tourism; Service dominant logic; Service systems; Computer simulation; Industry; Sustainable development; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Baidal, J.I., Tourism planning in spain evolution and perspectives (2004) Annals of Tourism Research, 31 (2), pp. 313-333; Casakin, H., Metaphor in design problem solving implications for creativity (2007) International Journal of Design, 1 (2), pp. 21-33; (2007) Leisure Agriculture Development and Promotion Project Performance Report, Control Yuan Gazette, 2591. , http://www.cy.gov.tw/paper/096/mico/2591/2591_type21_01_p01.htm; Echtner, C., Ritchie, B., The meaning and measurement of destination image (2003) Journal of Tourism Studies, 14 (1), pp. 37-48; Huybers, T., Bennett, J., Inter-firm cooperation at nature based tourism destinations (2003) Journal of Socio-Economics, 32, pp. 571-587; Jackson, J., Developing regional tourism in China: The potential for activating business clusters in a socialist market economy (2006) Tourism Management, 27, pp. 695-706; Jocumsen, G., How do small business managers make strategic marketing decisions - A model of process?

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is one such platform that has been successful in providing integration and distribution in the business domain, and could be effective in other domains (e.g., scientific computing, healthcare, and complex decision making). In this paper, we discuss our application of SOA to provide an integration platform for socio-cultural analysis, a domain that, through models, tries to understand, analyze and predict relationships in large complex social systems. In developing this platform, called SORASCS, we had to overcome issues we believe are generally applicable to any application of SOA within a domain that involves technically naïve users and seeks to establish a sustainable software ecosystem based on a common integration platform. We discuss these issues, the lessons learned about the kinds of problems that occur, and pathways toward a solution. © 2011 ACM.;"platform design; service oriented architectures; socio-cultural analysis";"Business domain; Complex decision; Complex social systems; Integration platform; Platform design; Service Oriented; socio-cultural analysis; Software ecosystems; Software-based; Decision making; Health care; Information services; Integration; Software engineering; Service oriented architecture (SOA)";;;;;;;"Arsanjani, A., Ghosh, S., Allam, A., Abdollah, T., Ganapathy, S., Holley, K., SOMA: A method for developing service-oriented solutions (2008) IBM Systems Journal, 47 (3); Borgatti, S., Evrett, M., Freeman, L., (2002) UCINET 6 for Windows: Software for Social Network Analysis User's Guide, , Analytic Technologies; Carley, K., A Theory of Group Stability (1991) American Sociological Review, 56, pp. 331-354; Carley, K.M., Dynamic Network Analysis (2003) Dynamic Social Network Modeling and Analysis: Workshop Summary and Papers, , Breiger, R., Carley, K., Pattison, P.

SeCo queries extract ranked information about several interconnected domains, such as ""hotels"", ""restaurants"" or ""concerts"", by interacting with Web data sources which are wrapped as search services; an example of query is: ""Find a good Jazz concert close to the user's current location, together with close-by good restaurants and hotels"". The SeCo system supports the deployment of search applications, by providing a generic software architecture and the tools for service and query registration, for query formulation and execution, and for result browsing. In this demo paper, we focus on the Liquid Query (LQ) interface which supports the iteration over query formulation, result visualization and query refinement, with commands for perusing the result set, changing the visualization of data based on their type (e.g., geographical or temporal) and interacting with the remote search services. It also supports an exploratory search approach, where the user starts by accessing one data source (e.g., an event listing for finding interesting concerts), then is assisted in progressively joining other correlated sources in an interactive exploration of the search space. The exploration paths can be chosen on the fly and the navigation history can be browsed back and forth for cross-checking the retrieved options. © 2011 ACM.";"exploratory search; graphical user interface; multi-domain search; web data integration";"Correlated sources; Data source; Exploratory search; Information spaces; Interactive exploration; Interconnected domains; Multi domains; On the flies; Query formulation; Query refinement; Search application; Search computing; Search services; Search spaces; System supports; Vertical search engine; Web data integration; Web data sources; Data handling; Data visualization; Graphical user interfaces; Liquids; Search engines; Software architecture; Visualization; World Wide Web";;;;;;;"Ceri, S., Brambilla, M., Search Computing Challenges and Directions (2010) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5950. , Springer-Verlag, April 2010; Ceri, S., Brambilla, M., New Trends in Search Computing (2011) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6585. , Springer-Verlag, March 2011, in print; Ceri, S., Braga, D., Corcoglioniti, F., Grossniklaus, M., Vadacca, S., Search Computing (2010) Keynote Speech at ICOODB, Zurich, September 2010; Braga, D., Ceri, S., Daniel, F., Martinenghi, D., Optimization of Multi-Domain Queries on the Web (2008) Proceedings of VLDB 2008, Auckland, August 2008; Bozzon, A., Brambilla, M., Ceri, S., Fraternali, P., Liquid Query: Multi-Domain Exploratory Search on the Web (2010) Proceedings of WWW 2010, Raleigh, pp. 161-170; Campi, A., Ceri, S., Maesani, A., Ronchi, S., Designing Service Marts for Engineering Search Computing Applications (2010) Proc. of ICWE 2010, Wien, July 2010; De Vries, A., Alink, W., Cornacchia, R., Search by strategy (2010) ESAIR Workshop at CIKCM'10, pp. 27-28; Huynh, D., Karger, D., Miller, R., Exhibit: Lightweight structured data publishing (2007) WWW Conf. 2007, pp. 737-746; Kuhlthau, C.C., Kuhlthau's information search process (2005) Theories of Information Behavior, pp. 230-234. , Medford, NJ: Information Today (2005); Kumar, R., Tomkins, A., A Characterization of Online Search Behaviour (2009) Data Engineering Bullettin, 32 (2). , June 2009 (2009); Marchionini, G., Exploratory search: From finding to understanding (2006) Commun.

Still, not considering the possible market exploitation of such a project could be misleading also in terms of technology investigation. At the half of the project, when many technology and research decisions still must be taken, it is important to consider also the possible implications of such decisions on possible future business models. The present chapter is aimed at understanding the possible future trajectories for the exploitation options of the SeCo project. The chapter starts identifying roles and capabilities of a potential SeCo value chain. The second step is defining some archetypal Business Models investigating the option of having some of the previous roles not managed internally but delegated to the external market. Finally the business models are compared and recommendations for the following of the project are drawn. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.;"advertising models; cloud computing; development process; Search Computing; software architectures; software engineering";"Advertising models; Business models; Commercial venture; development process; External market; Possible futures; Search Computing; Value chains; Computer systems; Marketing; Models; Software architecture; Cloud computing";;;;;;;"Bhattacharya, S., Krishnan, V., Mahajan, V., Managing New Product Definition in Highly Dynamic Environments (1998) Management Science, 44 (11 PART 2), pp. S50-S64; Cusumano, M.A., Selby, R., (1995) Microsoft Secrets, , Free Press, New York; Iansiti, M., MacCormack, A., Developing Products on Internet Time (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75, pp. 108-117; MacCormack, A., Verganti, R., Iansiti, M., Developing Products on Internet Time: The Anatomy of a Flexible Development Process (2001) Management Science, 47 (1), pp. 133-150; Mizk, N., Jacobson, R., Trading off between Value Creation and Value Appropriation: The Financial Implications of Shifts in Strategic Emphasis (2003) Journal of Marketing, 67, pp. 63-76; Porter, M.E., Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior (1985) Performance, , The Free Press, New York; Teece, D.J., Profiting from Technological Innovation: Implications for Integration, Collaboration, Licensing and Public Policy (1986) Research Policy, 15, pp. 285-305; Teece, D.J., Pisano, G., The Dynamic Capabilities of Firms: An Introduction (1994) Industrial and Corporate Change, 3 (3), pp. 537-556; Teece, D.J., Pisano, G., Shuen, A., Dynamic Capabilities Management and Strategic (1997) Strategic Management Journal, 18 (7), pp. 509-533; Verganti, R., Planned Flexibility: Linking Anticipation and Reaction in Product Development Projects (1999) J.

Companies work cooperatively and competitively in order to achieve their strategic objectives. They must engage in a new perspective considering both their own business and third party ones. Inspired from properties by natural and business ecosystems, a software ecosystem covers technical and business aspects of software development as well as partnership among companies. In this paper, we undertake a systematic mapping study to present a wide review of primary studies on software ecosystems. Systematic mapping is a methodology that gives, after a systematic research process, a visual summary map of its results. The search procedure identified 1026 studies, of which 44 were identified as relevant to answer our research questions. This study mapped what is currently known about software ecosystems perspective. We conclude that software ecosystems research is concentrated in 8 main areas in which the most relevant are open source software, ecosystem modeling, and business issues. The paper is intended to practitioners and academics investigating the field of software ecosystems. It contributes to summarize the body of knowledge in the field and direct efforts for future research in software ecosystems.;"Business ecosystem; Digital ecosystem; Software ecosystem; Systematic mapping study";"Industry; Mapping; Research; Software engineering; Business ecosystem; Complex relationships; Digital ecosystem; Open Source Software; Software ecosystems; Strategic objectives; Systematic mapping studies; Systematic research; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Arndt, J.M., Dibbern, J., Co-innovation in a service oriented strategic network (2006) IEEE International Conference on Services Computing; Moore, J.F., Predators and prey: A new ecology of competition (1993) Harvard Business Review, pp. 75-86. , May/June; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., Strategy as ecology (2004) Harvard Business Review, 82 (3), pp. 68-78; Petersen, K., Feldt, R., Mujtaba, S., Mattsson, M., Systematic mapping studies in software engineering (2008) 12th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering; Kitchenham, B., Procedures for performing systematic reviews (2004) Joint Technical Report, Software Engineering Group, Keele University, and Empirical Software Eng., , Nat'l ICT Australia; Budgen, D., Turner, M., Brereton, P., Kitchenham, B., Using mapping studies in software engineering (2008) Proceedings of PPIG 2008, pp. 195-204; Petticrew, M., Roberts, H., (2008) Systematic Reviews in the Social Sciences: A Practical Guide; Brereton, P., Kitchenham, B., Budgen, D., Turner, M., Khalil, M., Lessons from applying the systematic literature review process within the software engineering domain (2007) The Journal of Systems and Software, pp. 571-583; Fink, A., (2010) Conducting Research Literature Reviews: from the Internet to Paper, , Sage Publications. 3nd edition; Kitchenham, B., (2007) Guidelines for Performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, , vol 2. 3 EBSE Technical Report; Kitchenham, B., Brereton, P., Budgen, D., Turner, M., Bailey, J., Linkman, S., Systematic literature reviews in software engineering - A systematic literature review (2009) Information and Software Technology, 51 (1); Dyba, T., Dingsoyr, T., Empirical studies of agile software development: A systematic review (2008) Information and Software Technology, 50, pp. 833-859; Seaman, C.B., Qualitative methods in empirical studies of software engineering (1999) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 25 (4), pp. 557-572";;;;CEUR-WS;3rd International Workshop on Software Ecosystems 2011, IWSECO 2011;7 June 2011 through 7 June 2011;Brussels;101600;16130073;;;;English;CEUR Workshop Proc.;Conference Paper;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84890877584

Box 68511, Rio de Janeiro, 21945-970, Brazil";Software Ecosystems (SECOs) have emerged as an approach to improve software reuse in industry considering relations among companies and stakeholders. Companies and organizations have opened up their platforms and artifacts to others, including partners and third-part developers around the world. This changes the traditional software industry because it requires mature research in software architecture, component-based software engineering and software product line in a market and business environment. In this sense, this paper presents an initial proposal for SECOs engineering in order to outline a set of steps that combines three different dimensions of SECOs and joins different perspectives in SECOs research literature through a survey. In this paper, the focus is on the first dimension, that is, architecture. A preliminary analysis done by the Brazilian Software Reuse Lab's SECOs at COPPE/UFRJ points out that several concepts presented at IWSECO 2009 and IWSECO 2010 can be connected in a broader SE approach.;"Component-based software engineering; Software ecosystems; Software reuse; Value-based software engineering";"Computer software reusability; Industry; Software engineering; AND joins; Business environments; Component-based software engineering; Preliminary analysis; Software ecosystems; Software industry; Software Product Line; Value-based software engineerings; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Alspaugh, T.A., Asuncion, H.U., Scacchi, W., The role of software licenses in open architecture ecosystems (2010) Proceedings of the 1st IWSECO, pp. 4-18. , 11th ICSR, Falls Church, USA, September; Anvaari, M., Jansen, S., Evaluating architectural openness in mobile software platforms (2010) Proc. of the 4th ECSA, pp. 85-92. , 2nd IWSECO, Copenhagen, Denmark, Aug; Boehm, B., A view of 20th and 21st century software engineering (2006) Proceedings of the 28th ICSE, pp. 12-29. , Shanghai, China, May; Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystem (2009) Proceedings of 13th SPLC, pp. 1-10. , San Francisco, CA, USA, August; Bosch, J., Architecture challenges for software ecosystems (2010) Proceedings of the 4th ECSA, pp. 93-95. , 2nd IWSECO, Copenhagen, Denmark, August; Boucharas, V., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Formalizing software ecosystem modeling (2009) Proc. of the 1st IWSECO, pp. 34-48. , 11th ICSR, Falls Church, USA, Sep; Campbell, P.R.J., Ahmed, F., A three-dimensional view of software ecosystems (2010) Proc. of the 4th ECSA, pp. 81-84. , 2nd IWSECO, Copenhagen, Denmark, Aug; Capuruço, R.A.C., Capretz, L.F., Integrating recommender information in social ecosystems decisions (2010) Proc. of the 4th ECSA, pp. 143-150. , 2nd IWSECO, Copenhagen, Denmark, August; Cataldo, M., Herbsleb, J.D., Architecting in software ecosystems: Interface translucence as an enabler for scalable collaboration (2010) Proceedings of the 4th ECSA, pp. 65-72. , 2nd IWSECO, Copenhagen, Denmark, August; Dhungana, D., Groher, I., Schludermann, E., Biffl, S., Software ecosystems vs. Natural ecosystems: Learning from the ingenious mind of nature (2010) Proceedings of the 4th ECSA, pp. 96-102. , 2nd IWSECO, Copenhagen, Denmark, August; Fricker, S., Specification and analysis of requirements negotiation strategy in software ecosystems (2009) Proc. of the 1st IWSECO, pp. 19-33. , 11th ICSR, Falls Church, USA; Hunink, I., Van Erk, R., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Industry taxonomy engineering: The case of the european software ecosystem (2010) Proceedings of the 4th ECSA, pp. 111-118. , 2nd IWSECO, Copenhagen, Denmark, August; Iansiti, M., Levien, R., (2004) The Keystone Advantage: What the New Dynamics of Business Ecosystems Mean for Strategy, Innovation and Sustainability, , Harvard Business Scholl Press; Jansen, S., Finkelstein, A., Brinkkemper, S., A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems (2009) Proc. of the 31st ICSE, New and Emerging Research Track, pp. 187-190. , Vancouver, BC, Canada, May; Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Finkelstein, A., Business network management as a survival strategy: A tale of two software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 1st IWSECO, pp. 34-48. , 11th ICSR, Falls Church, USA, September; Kittlaus, H.B., Clough, P.N., (2009) Software Product Management and Pricing: Key Success Factors for Software Organizations, , Springer Publishing Company; McGregor, J.D., A method for analyzing software product line ecosystems (2010) Proceedings of the 4th ECSA, pp. 73-80. , 2nd IWSECO, Copenhagen, Denmark, August; Messerschmitt, D.G., Szyperski, C., (2003) Software Ecosystem: Understanding An Indispensable Technology and Industry, , The MIT Press; Moore, J.F., (1996) The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems, , Harper Business; Montoni, M.A., Rocha, A.R., Weber, K.C., MPS.BR: A successful program for software process improvement in brazil (2009) Sof.

Since the business environment is becoming more and more unpredictable, business process management as part of enterprise engineering is supposed to tackle value creation challenges but also the ones related to value preservation. The aim for agility and required approaches are an essential requirement for many Digital Ecosystem Domains, such as in The Future of Energy. Here, procurers of energy have to be orchestrated in the Energy Market. Our research emphasizes risk driven business process design. A graphical modelling language for risk driven business process engineering was introduced in former papers. This paper extends the language and handles questions related to modeling risk in an organizational context. © 2010 IEEE.;"Business process modeling; Enterprise integration; Meta model; Methodological framework; Risk modeling";"Business process modeling; Enterprise Integration; Meta model; Methodological frameworks; Risk modeling; Ecosystems; Enterprise resource management; Industry; Process design; Risk assessment";;;;;;;"Sienou, A., (2009) Proposition D'un Cadre Methodologique Pour le Management Integre des Risques et des Processus D'entreprise, , These de doctorat (PhD thesis).

In these ecosystems, learning resources are pervasive and dynamic. A key challenge is to develop a scalable learning system that addresses the inherent complexity of learning sessions and cater for the specific needs and requirements of individual learners. In this paper, we adopt autonomic Web services to capture disparate learning resources and build an autonomic digital learning ecosystem that reconfigures itself in response to changes in the environment such as learners' profiles, resource availabilities, and type of instructional material. The use of autonomic Web services permits to abstract the learning resources into distributed and uniformly structured objects and to record learners' attributes into a packaged profile. These Web services sense the learning context and coach learners in their pursuit of constructive instructional sessions. A service-oriented architecture is proposed to connect learning resources, learners' profiles, and contextual indicators. A prototype is, also, illustrated in the paper to show the feasibility of the proposed solutions. © 2010 IEEE.;"Autonomic system; Learner profile; Learning technology; Web service";"Autonomic Systems; Contextual indicators; Digital-learning; Information and Communication Technologies; Inherent complexity; Instructional materials; Learner profiles; Learning context; Learning resource; Learning sessions; Learning technology; Resource availability; Ecosystems; Information services; Learning systems; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Technology; Web services";;;;;;;"Atif, Y., Benlamri, R., Berri, J., Learning objects based framework for self-adaptive learning (2003) Journal of Education and Information Technologies, 8 (4), pp. 345-368. , Kluwer Academic Publishing; Atif, Y., Benlamri, R., Berri, J., Can e-learning be made realtime?

The recent advent of service-oriented architectures (SOA) built on Web services is a first attempt to streamline respectively automate those tasks in order to increase productivity. SOAP-based services work well within a company and are thus mainly used to for the integration of legacy systems which have not been built to be Web-friendly or to make new systems more flexible for changing requirements in business ecosystems. Nevertheless, the utopian promise of uniform service interface standards, metadata and universal service registries, in the form of the SOAP, WSDL and UDDI standards have proven elusive. Instead, for Internet-scale applications, lightweight REST-based architectures which gained a lot of momentum recently provide a number of important advantages such as better scalability, reliability and visibility and are thus the preferred choice for Internet-scale applications. Despite the foreseeable potential, the increasing interest on and growing acceptance of lightweight services, there are still problems on formal describing, finding and orchestrating services as well as a lack of a holistic framework covering the entire service lifecycle. This paper focuses on an extensive survey comparing the traditional SOAP-based architecture to the emergent lightweight REST-based architectural style as a first step towards a framework proposal. © 2010 IEEE.;"Autonomic computing; Internet; Semantic Web services; Service composition; Service discovery; Service orchestration and choreography; Web 2.0; Web 3.0; Web services";"Autonomic Computing; Service compositions; Service discovery; Service orchestration and choreography; Web 2.0; Web 3.0; Architecture; Ecosystems; Information services; Internet; Legacy systems; Metadata; Quality of service; Semantic Web; Semantics; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Web services";;;;;;;"Feldman, S., Duhl, J., Rahal Marobella, J., Crawford, A., (2005) The Hidden Costs of Information Work, , Mar; Huynh, D., Mazzocchi, S., Karger, D., Piggy bank: Experience the semantic web inside your web browser (2005) LNCS, 3729, pp. 413-430. , Oct; Tholomé, E., (2009) A Well Earned Retirement for the SOAP Search API, , http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/08/well-earned-retirement-forsoap- search.html, Retrieved: Dec. 22.

Due to the dynamic nature of SOA the implementation of SOA brings about many challenges, for instance, in terms of service discovery, service interaction, service composition, robustness, quality of service, etc. SOA may often need to dynamically (re)organizing its topologies of interactions between the services because of unpredictable events, such as crashes or network problems which make the services unavailable. The complexity and dynamism of the current global digital network systems required an architecture that is capable of changing its structure and functionality autonomously to meet the dynamic changes in the requirements and environment with little human intervention. In this paper we present the idea of adapting the autonomic computing paradigm into SOA to meet those challenges. © 2010 IEEE.;"Autonomic computing; Selforganizing; Service ecosystem; Service-oriented architecture; Web services";"Atomic services; Autonomic Computing; Computational units; Digital networks; Dynamic changes; Dynamic nature; Human intervention; OR-networks; Self organizing; Service compositions; Service discovery; Service ecosystems; Service interaction; Ecosystems; Information services; Network architecture; Quality of service; Web services; Service oriented architecture (SOA)";;;;;;;"Lazovik, A., Arbab, F., Using Reo for service coordination (2007) Proc ICSOS 2007, pp. 398-403. , LNCS 4749, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg; Montresor, A., Meling, H., Babaoglu, O., Toward self-organizing, self-repairing, and resilient large-scale distributed systems (2002) Technical Report UBLCS-2002-10, , Department of Computer Science, University of Bologna, Italy, Sep; Kephart, J.O., Chess, D.M., The vision of autonomic computing (2003) Computer, 36 (1), pp. 41-50. , IEEE Computer Society, Jan; (2006) OASIS Reference Model for Service Oriented Architecture, , OASIS Standard, 12 Oct; (2004) Web Services Glossary, , W3C Working Group Note 11 Feb; Heydarnoori, A., Mavaddat, F., Arbab, F., Towards an automated deployment planner for composition of web services as software components (2006) Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Sciences, , Elsevier B.V; Huhns, M.N., Singh, M.P., Service-oriented computing: Key concepts and principles (2005) IEEE Internet Computing, pp. 75-81. , Jan-Feb; Arora, H., Raghu, T.S., Vinze, A., Brittenham, P., Collaborative self-configuration and learning in autonomic computing systems: Applications to supply chain (2006) Proc.

Such collaborative networks are by now often based on trusted and well known communities and require IT support agility and interoperability. The European Union promotes solutions to support and favor innovative business networks on the basis of an internet of services: these FP6 and FP7 projects results provide a consistent environment (including design, methods and developments related to Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) technology) to support technologically Business Service oriented organizations and the large-scale reinforcement of collaborative business and networked organization strategies. Nevertheless these works are mostly focused on an IT vision without taking into account business constraints. To overcome this limit, we propose a multi-dimensional service-chain ecosystem model, paying attention on service functional and non-functional properties description to support an efficient and consistent business service selection and composition process so that large-scale service based collaborative organization can emerge. © 2010 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.;"Business Services; Modeling; Process Maturity; Service Ecosystem";"Business constraints; Business networks; Business service; Collaborative network; Collaborative organizations; Ecosystem model; Enterprise service bus; European Union; Internet of Services; Modeling; Networked organizations; Non functional properties; Process maturity; Service chain; Service ecosystems; Service-based; Ecosystems; Innovation; Industrial management";;;;;;;"Chabeb, Y., Tata, S., Yet Another Semantic Annotation for WSDL (2008) IADIS International Conference WWW/Internet 2008, pp. 437-441; Daclin, N., Chen, D., Vallespir, B., Decisional Interoperability: Concepts and Formalisation (2006) IFIP, 224, pp. 297-304. , Proceedings of Network-Centric Collaboration and Supporting Frameworks, PRO-VE 2006.

Hence, their development and maintenance strategies must be redesigned. Humans should be relieved from an important part of these tasks, which should be performed by systems themselves; self-adaptation can be therefore considered as an architecture-level concern. Service-oriented architectures, and in particular service ecosystems as their more dynamic variant, show a higher degree of adaptivity and flexibility than many other alternatives. In this context, Agreement Technologies (AT) appears as a service-oriented, architecture-aware evolutions of Multi-Agent Systems, which themselves are self-aware structures conceived to solve generic problems. However, they still do not provide mechanisms to change their composition patterns and element types, which are necessary to achieve real self-adaptivity. This work proposes an architectural solution for it: the required dynamism will be supported by an emergent agreement - an evolving architectural structure based on combining predefined controls and protocols. These are handled in the context of the service-oriented, agent-based and organization-centric framework defined by AT, and implemented within the THOMAS platform. This work provides the first architectural abstractions to support this emergent structure. A real-world example showing the interest of this approach is also provided, and some conclusions about its applicability are finally outlined. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.";"Adaptive Architecture; Agreement Technologies; Multi-Agent Systems; Self-Adaptation; Service Ecosystem";"Adaptive architecture; Adaptive services; Adaptivity; Agent based; Agreement Technologies; Architectural solutions; Architectural structure; Composition patterns; Element type; Emergent structure; Higher-degree; Maintenance strategies; Real-world; Self adaptation; Self-adaptivity; Self-aware; Service ecosystems; Service Oriented; Adaptive architecture; Agreement technologies; Architectural solutions; Architectural structure; Composition patterns; Maintenance strategies; Self adaptation; Service ecosystems; Ecosystems; Information services; Internet; Internet protocols; Peer to peer networks; Quality of service; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Technology; Ecology; Ecosystems; Information services; Multi agent systems; Peer to peer networks; Quality of service; Multi agent systems; Service oriented architecture (SOA)";;;;;"TIN2009-13838; CONSOLIDER CSD2007-0022; IC0801; TIN2009-13839-C03-02";"Acknowledgements.

First, service ecosystems are market places for trading services in the business sense and involve actors from different legal bodies, Second service trade involves the following steps: service discovery, service selection, service contracting, service consumption, monitoring, and profiling. then,we extend the Triple-A supply chain concept toward two approach, first,we extend the supply chain to service Ecosystems,second, by add adoptability demension, we enlarge the Triple-A to Quad-A. based on above work, we put forward a Quad-A Service Ecosystems model. At last, we regard the keystone of Service Ecosystems should dominate the formation of Quad-A, and to improve the overall health of their ecosystems by providing a stable and predictable set of common assets. © 2010 IEEE.;"Keystone; Quad-A; Service ecosystems; Triple-A";"Business ecosystem; Keystone; Market place; Quad-A; Service contracting; Service discovery; Service ecosystems; Service selection; Trading services; Triple-A; Arches; Commerce; Industrial engineering; Information management; Innovation; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Moore, J.F., (1996) The Death of Competition: Leadership & Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems, p. 15. , New York: Harper Business; Peltoniemi, M., Cluster, Value Network and Business Ecosystem: Knowledge and Innovation Approach Organisations, Innovation and Complexity: New Perspectives on the Knowledge Economy Conference, September 9-10, 2004. in Manchester, UK, , Paper Presented at; Gossain, S., Kandiah, G., Reinventing Value: The New Business Ecosystem (1998) Strategy & Leadership, 26 (5), pp. 28-33; Barros, A., Dumas, M., Bruza, P., The move to Web service ecosystems (2005) BP Trends Newsletter, 3 (3), pp. 1-9; Barros, A., Dumas, M., The rise of Web service ecosystems (2006) IT Prof, 8 (5), pp. 31-37; Scheithauer, G., Augustin, S., Wirtz, G., Describing Services for Service Ecosystems Service-Oriented Computing - ICSOC 2008 Workshops, Springer, 2009, pp. 242-255; Barros, A.P., Dumas, M., The Rise ofWeb Service Ecosystems (2006) IT Professional, 8 (5), pp. 31-37; Spohrer, J., Maglio, P.P., Bailey, J., Gruhl, D., Steps toward a science of service systems (2007) IEEE Computer, 40 (1), pp. 71-77. , Jan; Kett, H., Voigt, K., Scheithauer, G., Cardoso, J., Service Engineering for Business Service Ecosystems Proceedings of the XVIII.

They also need to be able to keep in pace with their heterogeneous internal legacy systems, and can't change their infrastructure or applications for fast and short collaboration implying information and knowledge interchange. Current solutions are less and less adapted to face increasing needs and complexity. As proposing a new disruptive approach and technologies is inappropriate, the approach proposed by this paper is to build frameworks based on federation of existing eBusiness standards used by a given ecosystem, and allowing achieving ""pragmatic"" interoperability. This approach combines the advantage of using simultaneously Model Driven Engineering, Enterprise Modeling, Service Oriented Architecture and commodities on the WEB based on open and governed information and communication standards.

However, while service-oriented approaches acknowledge the importance of the service ecosystem, service lifecycle models are typically internally focused, paying limited attention to processes related to offering services to or using services from other actors. In this paper, we address this need by discussing the relations between a comprehensive service lifecycle approach for service management & engineering and the sourcing & purchasing of services. In particular we pay attention to the similarities and differences between sourcing business and software services, the alignment between service management & engineering and sourcing & purchasing, the role of sourcing in the transformation of an organization towards a service-oriented paradigm, the role of architectural approaches to sourcing in this transformation, and the sourcing of specific services at different levels of granularity.;"Business services; Service analysis; Service design; Service engineering; Service lifecycle; Service management; Service-oriented architecture; Software services; Sourcing";"Business service; Service analysis; Service design; Service engineering; Service lifecycle; Service management; Service Oriented; Software services; Sourcing; Information management; Information services; Information systems; Life cycle; Service oriented architecture (SOA)";;;;;;;"Cherbakov, L., Galambos, G., Harishankar, R., Kalyana, S., Rackham, G., Impact of service orientation at the business level (2005) IBM Systems Journal, 44 (4), pp. 653-668; Erl, T., (2005) Service-Oriented Architecture: Concepts, Technology, and Design, , 4th Edition.

We argue that this naturally calls for a nature-inspired approach, in which pervasive services are modeled and deployed as autonomous individuals in an ecosystem of other services, data sources, and pervasive devices. As an evolution of standard service-oriented architectures, we present a general framework framing the concepts expressed, and discuss a number of natural metaphors that we can adopt to concretely incarnate the proposed framework and implement pervasive service ecosystems.;;"Adaptive behavior; Data-sources; Evolvability; Open services; Pervasive devices; Pervasive service; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Ubiquitous computing; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Campbell, A.T., Eisenman, S.B., Lane, N.D., Miluzzo, E., Peterson, R.A., Lu, H., Zheng, X., Ahn, G.-S., The rise of people-centric sensing (2008) IEEE Internet Computing, 12 (4); Coleman, B., Using sensor inputs to affect virtual and real environments (2009) IEEE Pervasive Computing, 8 (3), pp. 16-23; Spohrer, J.C., Maglio, P.P., Bailey, J.H., Gruhl, D., Steps toward a science of service systems (2007) IEEE Computer, 40 (1), pp. 71-77; Ferscha, A., Vogl, S., Wearable displays - For everyone!

A new trend service ecosystem is merging, where service providers can augment their core services by using business service delivery-related available functionalities like distribution and delivery. The semantic service description of services for the business service delivery will become a bottleneck in the service ecosystem. In this chapter, the Visual Semantic Analysis approach is presented to support semi-automatic modeling of semantic service description by combining machine learning and interactive visualization techniques. Furthermore, two application scenarios from the project THESEUSTEXO (funded by German federal ministry of economics and technology) are presented as evaluation of the Visual Semantic Analysis approach. © 2011, IGI Global.;;;;;;;;;"Akkermans, H., Baida, Z., Gordijn, J., Pena, N., Altuna, A., Laresgoiti, I., Using ontologies to bundle real world services (2004) IEEE Intelligent Systems, 19, pp. 57-66. , doi, 10.1109/MIS.2004.35; Alter, S., Service system fundamentals: Work system, value chain, and life cycle (2008) IBM Systems Journal, 47, pp. 71-85. , doi, 10.1147/sj.471.0071; Ankolekar, A., Hobbs, J.R., Lassila, O., Martin, D.L., McIlraith, S.A., Narayanan, S., DAML-S: Semantic markup for web services (2001) Proceedings of the First Semantic Web Working Symposium (SWWS), p. 4. , Stanford University; Baida, Z., Gordijn, J., Akkermans, H., (2001) Service Ontology, , OBELIX Deliverable 6.1/Free University Amsterdam-Forschungsbericht; Barrett, M., Davidson, E., Middleton, C., Degross, J.I., (2008) Information Technology in the Service Economy: Challenges and Possibilities for the 21st Century, , Springer Publishing Company. doi:10.1007/978-0-387-09768-8; Barros, A., Dumas, M., The rise of web service ecosystems (2006) IT Professional, 8, pp. 31-37. , doi, 10.1109/MITP.2006.123; Barros, A., Dumas, M., Bruza, P., (2005) The Move to Web Service Ecosystems, , BPTrends; Basole, R.C., Rouse, W.B., Complexity of service value networks: Conceptualization and empirical investigation (2008) IBM Systems Journal, 47 (1), pp. 31-37. , doi, 10.1147/sj.471.0053; Bendaoud, R., Toussaint, Y., Napoli, A., PACTOLE: A methodology and a system for semi-automatically enriching an ontology from a collection of texts (2008) Proceedings ICCS 2008; Berbner, R., (2007) Dienstgüteunterstützung Für Service-orientierte Workows, , Technischen Universität Darmstadt, Diss; Berre, A.J., UPMS-UML pro-le and metamodel for services- an emerging standard (2008) Proceedings of the 12th International IEEE Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference; Bhatti, N., Web-based semantic visualization to explore knowledge spaces-an approach for learning by exploring (2008) Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education (AACE): Proceedings of ED-Media 2008 World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia & Telecommunications, pp. 312-317. , In J.

Examples include intelligent devices, sensors embedded in the environment and the emerging Internet-of-Things. Simultaneously users are becoming increasingly involved as information providers and consumers by means of Web 2.0 and social media. While these areas have gained a lot of attention recently and while the research on Digital Ecosystems has also dealt with these phenomena separately there seems to be need for research on the rich and complex ecosystem combining the sensor-based information sources with Web 2.0 and mobile services. In this paper, we propose a digital ecosystem architecture for ubiquitous campus Living Lab innovation platform which combines sensor based embedded system and social media based on the international collaboration between two long-term university Living Lab research projects in Finland and China. The paper focuses on the architecture design and implementation of the platform, and also discusses its implications to digital ecosystem research.

Service orientation is a strategic approach to deal with such complexity, and various stakeholders' information systems. Services or more precisely the autonomous computational agents implementing the services, provide an architectural pattern able to cope with the needs of integrated and distributed collaborative solutions. This paper proposes a service-oriented framework, aiming to support a virtual organizations breeding environment which is the basis to establish short or long term goal-oriented virtual organizations. The notion of integrated business services, where customers receive some value developed through the contribution from a network of companies is a key element. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2010.;"Collaborative Networks; Service Oriented Architecture; Service Oriented computing; Virtual Organizations";"Architectural pattern; Breeding environments; Collaborative network; Information and Communication Technologies; Multi-disciplinary approach; Multiple stakeholders; Service oriented computing; Virtual organization; Architectural pattern; Breeding environments; Collaborative network; Information and Communication Technologies; Multi-disciplinary approach; Service oriented computing; Service oriented frameworks; Virtual organization; Automation; Autonomous agents; Information services; Information technology; Manufacture; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Automation; Complex networks; Distributed computer systems; Information services; Manufacture; Societies and institutions; Web services; Complex networks; Service oriented architecture (SOA)";;;;;;;"Laskey, K., Reference architecture foundation for service oriented architecture version 1.0 (2009) Public Review Draft, 2. , October 14; Zhang, L.-J., IEEE EIC editorial: Introduction to the body of knowledge areas of services computing (2008) IEEE Trans. on Services Computing, 1 (2). , April-June; Camarinha-Matos, L.M., Afsarmanesh, H., Ollus, M., ECOLEAD and CNO base concepts (2008) Methods and Tools for Collaborative Networked Organizations, pp. 3-32. , May 9 Springer, Heidelberg; Afsarmanesh, H., Camarinha-Matos, L.M., A framework for management of virtual organization breeding environments (2005) Collaborative Network and their Breeding Environments, 186, pp. 35-48. , Springer, Heidelberg; Camarinha-Matos, L.M., Afsarmanesh, H., The emerging discipline of collaborative networks (2004) Virtual Enterprises and Collaborative Networks, 149, pp. 3-16. , Springer, Heidelberg; Afsarmanesh, H., Camarinha-Matos, L.M., Ermilova, ekaterina: VBE reference framework (2008) Methods and Tools for Collaborative Networked Organizations, pp. 35-68. , Springer, New York; Nikolaou, C., Marina, B., Towards a theory of emergent service value networks - And an application, in an e-learning service economy in FET proactive workshop on objective IST-2007.8.4 (2007) The Science of Complex Systems for Socially Intelligent ICT Complexity Research Projects Forum, , ECCS 2007 Dresden, October 6; Rolland, C., Nurcan, S., Grosz, G., A unified framework for modeling co-operative design processes and co-operative business processes (1998) The Proceedings of the 31st Annual Int.

Today, it is typically performed in manual integration projects by highly skilled integration experts on the consumer side. As consumers demand flexible and adaptable enterprise systems with lower total cost of ownership (TCO), enterprise system vendors need to provide efficient mechanisms to integrate services within business applications. For this less explored but promising area of service-oriented architecture (SOA) research, a service integration framework with a pattern-based modeling approach is presented that allows for the integration of services into business applications at a later stage in the software-lifecycle - especially after shipment.;"Business application extensibility; Service ecosystems; Service integration; SOA; Web services";"Business applications; Enterprise services; Enterprise system; Integration of services; Integration projects; Model-based; Modeling approach; Service ecosystems; Service integration; SOA; Total cost of ownership; Ecosystems; Electronic commerce; Enterprise resource planning; Industry; Information services; Integration; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Web services";;;;;;;"Allgaier, M., Heller, M., Industrial experiences for service oriented computing (2009) Research Challenges for Seamless Service Integration in Extensible Enterprise Systems, Workshop, , Stockholm, Sweden; Allgaier, M., Heller, M., Weidner, M., Towards a model-based service integration framework for extensible enterprise systems (2010) Tagungsband der Multikonferenz Wirtschattsinformatik, , M.

Earlier contributions on this field have provided a solid initial framework and they are considered starting points for this work. Based on two well-known approaches, the CIMOSA and ARCON modeling frameworks, what this work proposes is a set of modeling constructs for CNO modeling under a service-orientation perspective. Service Entities are incorporated as a third approach that may be considered if service ecosystems are being modeled. © 2010 IFIP.;"Collaborative Networks Reference Modeling; Service Ecosystems; Service Oriented Architectures";"Collaborative network; Digital ecosystem; Key topics; Modeling construct; Modeling frameworks; Reference modeling; Scientific discipline; Service ecosystems; Service orientation; Service Oriented; Ecosystems; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Virtual corporation; Network architecture";;;;;;;"Camarinha-Matos, L., Afsarmanesh, H., Towards a reference model for Collaborative Networked Organizations (2006) Proceedings of BASYS 2006.

The adoption of these approaches represents a significant shift in traditional software development style and process methodology. Currently several organizations are in practice with this new process model which embraces business, third party involvement and open architecture as its central pillars and these institutions have thrived as a result. The advent of software ecosystems have caused major players in the software industry to rethink their operating practices and engage with third parties, opening their platforms to external entities to attain business objectives. In this paper we present a three dimensional view of the software ecosystem model examine the role played by each of the three central pillars; business; architecture; and social aspects. We further highlight their relationships and conclude that this study will help in further aiding understanding of the overall engineering process of ecosystem software. © 2010 ACM.";"architecture; software ecosystems; software product lines";"Business objectives; Engineering process; Large organizations; New process; Open architecture; Operating practices; Software development styles; Software ecosystems; Software industry; Software Product Line; Third parties; Ecosystems; Industry; Product development; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Software design; Technical presentations; Three dimensional; Software architecture";;;;;;;"Bosch, J., From software product lines to software ecosystems (2009) LNCS, , In Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Software Product Lines (SPLC)Springer; Kittlaus, H.-B., Clough, P.N., (2009) Software Product Management and Pricing: Key Success Factors for Software Organizations, , Springer Publishing Company; Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Finkelstein, A., Business Network Management as a Survival Strategy: A Tale of Two Software Ecosystems (2009) 1st International Workshop on Software Ecosystems, 505. , CEUR-WS; Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Finkelstein, A., A Sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems (2009) Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 187-190. , New and Emerging Research Track, 2009; Martensen, A., Dahlgaard, J.J., Strategy and planning for innovation management, a business excellence approach (1999) International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 16 (8), pp. 734-755; Harrison, E.F., Strategic planning maturities (1995) Management Decisions, 33 (2), pp. 48-55; Garlan, D., Perry, D., Introduction to the special issue on software architecture (1995) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 21 (4), pp. 269-274; Jazayeri, M., Ran, A., Van Der Linden, F., (2000) Software Architecture for Product Families: Principles and Practice, , Addison Wesley; Snyder, M., Cantor, N., Understanding personality and social behavior: A functionalist strategy (1998) The Handbook of Social Psychology, 1, pp. 635-679. , D.T.

These actors, and especially the software organization that is at the core of this ecosystem, are having difficulties in getting insight into this ecosystem and how their actions influence its performance. In this paper a model is presented that describes the key characteristics of a Software Ecosystem. The central hub of a Software Ecosystem can use data on these characteristics to its strategic advantage. This is demonstrated by the use of the model in a case study of a hub in a software ecosystem. © 2010 ACM.;"business ecosystems; software ecosystems";"Assessment models; Business ecosystem; Key characteristics; Software company; software ecosystems; Software organization; Strategic advantages; Industry; Software architecture; Technical presentations; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"(2010) Antitrust: Commission Welcomes Microsoft's Roll-out of Web Browser Choice, , http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/ 216&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN, March 2.

Without such a method, taxonomies remain erroneous, making the development of, for instance, a directory of companies for research, extremely hard. This paper presents a method for creating complete and encompassing domain specific taxonomies. With such a method, researchers can create complete, consistent, taxonomies that in turn provide a strong basis for data model development.

This establishes a community that further accelerates the sharing of knowledge, content, issues, expertise, and skills. A number of major international software development organizations including Amazon, Nokia, and Apple are pioneering the development of software ecosystems and the area is currently gaining significant momentum in the software field, making it an essential area for research. This workshop aims to enhance current understanding and knowledge in this field by providing a forum for leading scientists and software professionals to exchange ideas and discuss current results. Such a forum will help to foster a mutual understanding of the current and future issues that face professionals involved in the development of software. Furthermore as software ecosystems are novel area of research this forum will provide an essential platform in which current work can be presented and discussed and future research directions identified. © 2010 ACM.;;"Future research directions; International workshops; Mutual understanding; Software development organizations; Software ecosystems; Software platforms; Ecosystems; Knowledge management; Product development; Research; Software architecture; Technical presentations; Software design";;;;;;;"Cataldo, M., Herbsleb, J.D., Architecting in Software Ecosystems: Interface Translucence as an Enabler for Scalable Collaboration Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in; Hunink, I., Van Erk, R., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Knowledge Management in Software Ecosystems: Software Artefacts as First-class Citizens Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in; Dhungana, D., Groher, I., Schludermann, E., Biffl, S., Software Ecosystems vs. Natural Ecosystems: Learning from the Ingenious Mind of Nature Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in; Bosch, J., Architecture Challenges for Software Ecosystems Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in; Anvaari, M., Jansen, S., Evaluating Architectural Openness in Mobile Software Platforms Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in; Van Den Berk, I., Jansen, S., Luinenburg, L., Software Ecosystems: A Software Ecosystem Strategy Assessment Model Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in; Pettersson, O., Svensson, M., Gil, D., Andersson, J., Milrad, M., On the Role of Software Process Modeling in Software Ecosystem Design Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in; Dos Santos, R.P., Werner, C.M.L., Revisiting the Concept of Components in Software Engineering from a Software Ecosystem Perspective Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in; Seichter, D., Dhungana, D., Pleuss, A., Hauptmann, B., Knowledge Management in Software Ecosystems: Software Artefacts as First-class Citizens Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in; Capuruco, R.A.C., Capretz, L.F., Integrating Recommender Information in Social Ecosystems Decisions Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in; Campbell, P.R.J., Ahmed, F., A Three- Dimensional View of Software Ecosystems Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in; McGregor, J.D., A Method for Analyzing Software Product Line Ecosystems Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on Software Ecosystems in Conjunction with 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA2010), Copenhagen, , To Appear in";"Campbell, P.

Information, artifacts, customers, money and products move among these entities as a part of the planning, development, and deployment processes. In this paper we present an analysis technique that uses the economic notion of a transaction to examine the transfers between the entities. The result of the analysis is data that is used to evaluate and structure the organization.

The organization developing the product actively seeks to involve external developers to add functionality to the system. On the other hand, external developers flock to a successful product as it provides an established market where underserved niches provide a business opportunity for these players. The product or product line evolves into a platform for external developers. This causes several software architecture challenges for a software ecosystem, including interface stability, evolution management, guaranteeing security and reliability and composition of independently developed functionality. The paper describes these challenges, discusses practical solutions and identifies research challenges. © 2010 ACM.;;"Business opportunities; Interface stabilities; Practical solutions; Product-lines; Research challenges; Software ecosystems; Software products; Ecosystems; Software reliability; Technical presentations; Software architecture";;;;;;;Bosch, J., From Software Product Lines to Software Ecosystems Proceedings of the 13th International Software Product Line Conference (SPLC 2009), August 2009;"Bosch, J.; Intuit, Mountain View, CA, United States; email: Jan@JanBosch.com";;"FIRST;SAS";;4th European Conference on Software Architecture: Doctoral Symposium, Industrial Track and Workshops, ECSA 2010;23 August 2010 through 26 August 2010;Copenhagen;82239;;9,78145E+12;;;English;ACM Int.

ECSA has matured from a workshop format to a full software engineering conference in the subfield of software architecture. This year, ECSA has become more ambitious and expanded its scope and schedule up to four full days. The program includes a series of tutorials, a doctoral mentoring program, and four full-day workshops. New and existing software challenges have led to a variety of trends in software architecture research, which makes the conference and workshops more attractive and promotes the discussion on current and emerging topics. Based on the scientific and technical interest of the topics, the innovativeness of workshop topics, and the capacity of the conference workshop program, the workshop co-chairs selected four workshops from the nine submitted proposals. We summarize the aims and goals of each workshop and the contributions accepted for the four workshops: • 2nd International Workshop on Software Ecosystems (EcoSys). Piers Campbell, Faheem Ahmed, Jan Bosch, Sliger Jansen. • 1st International Workshop on Measurability of Security in Software Architectures (MeSSa). Reijo Savola, Teemu Kranstén, Antti Evesti. • 8th Nordic Workshop on Model Driven Software Engineering (NW-MODE). Andrzej Wasowski, Dragos Truscan, Ludwik Kuzniarz. • 1st International Workshop on Variability in Software Product Line Architectures (VARI-ARCH). Alexander Helleboogh, Paris Avgeriou, Nelis Boucke, Patryck Heymans. The ECSA 2010 Workshop co-chairs would like to thanks all workshop organizers for their effort and enthusiasm to attract submission in different software architecture research topics and make the ECSA 2010 workshops a success. © 2010 ACM.;;"Architecture research; Campbell; Emerging topics; Innovativeness; International workshops; Mentoring programs; Model driven software engineering; On currents; Scotland; Software ecosystems; Software product line architecture; Ecology; Research; Technical presentations; Software architecture";;;;;;;"Cataldo, M., Herbsleb, J.D., Architecting in Software Ecosystems: Interface Translucence As An Enabler for Scalable Collaboration; Hunink, I., Van Erk, R., Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Knowledge Management in Software Ecosystems: Software Artefacts As First-class Citizens; Dhungana, D., Groher, I., Schludermann, E., Biffl, S., Software Ecosystems Vs.

Understanding the software's role in a larger perspective and how it interconnects with stakeholders is key for progress in those directions. However, for SECOs, several theoretical and methodological gaps remain to be charted. This paper identifies one such gap, the need for precise process modeling. It elaborates on experiences gained from the analysis of a SECO for mobile learning and brings up several aspects and insights for this particular domain. The main contributions are an initial reference model for the mobile learning domain and an outline for an analysis method for domain specific SECOs. © 2010 ACM.;"mobile learning ecosystem; software ecosystems; software process modeling";"Analysis method; Domain specific; End-users; Mobile Learning; mobile learning ecosystem; Process Modeling; Reference models; Role of software; Software development process; Software ecosystems; Software process modeling; Computer software reusability; Ecosystems; Reusability; Software architecture; Technical presentations; Software design";;;;;;;"Bittencourt, I., Costa, E., Isotani, S., Mizoguchi, R., Bittencourt, I., Towards a Reference Model to Semantic Web-based Educational Systems (2008) Workshop on Semantic Web and Education, Fortaleza, Brazil.

The potentially transformational benefits of software ecosystems stems, primarily, from two basic principles that software ecosystems have embraced: transparency, a pillar in open source development, and modular system design. Despite the benefits associated with transparency and modularity, there are also important challenges that deserve attention. In this paper, we introduce the concept of interface translucence as an architectural mechanism that seeks to overcome challenges faced by transparency and modular system design. Interface translucence leverages the important technical role that interfaces play in software architectures to bridge the technical and socio-organizational dimensions of software development in ecosystems. We present an application of the concept of interface translucence in the context of architecting a software system as well as in the context of implementing it. We conclude with a discussion of future research work. © 2010 ACM.;"awareness; collaboration; interface translucence; modularity; software architecture; software ecosystems";"awareness; collaboration; interface translucence; modularity; Software ecosystems; Computer software; Ecosystems; Software design; Technical presentations; Transparency; Software architecture";;;;;;;"Allen, R., Garlan, D., A Formal Basis for Architectural Connection (1997) ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, 6 (3), pp. 213-249; Baldwin, C.Y., Clark, K.B., (2000) Design Rules: The Power of Modularity, , MIT Press, Boston, MA; Bandi, R.K., Predicting Maintenance Performance Using Object-Oriented Design Complexity Measures (2003) IEEE Trans. on Software Eng., 29 (1 JAN. 2003), pp. 77-87; Bass, L., Berenbach, B., Leadership and Management in Software Architecture (LMSA'08): A Report on an ICSE Workshop (2008) ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, 33 (4 JUL. 2008), pp. 27-29; Bass, M., Architectural Misalignment: An Experience Report (2007) Proc. of the 6th Int'l Conf. on Software Architectures (Mumbai, India, January 03-06, 2007).

In this sense, this paper revisits the concept of components in SE through a sociotechnical construction. Based on a ranking of its critical elements, a study shows that components are assets in a set of collaborative/local environments more than in global/corporate markets. So, an approach called Brechó-VCM was proposed to treat some of these elements, providing an environment to discuss the future of Software Reuse on a software ecosystem perspective. These analyses, as well as their results, reinforce that SE community needs to learn with the components case and effectively looks at SE future in a sociotechnical way. © 2010 ACM.;"Brechó-VCM; component market; sociotechnical approach; software ecosystem; software reuse; value-based software engineering";"component market; Socio-technical approach; Software ecosystems; Software Re-use; Value-based; Commerce; Ecosystems; Software architecture; Technical presentations; Computer software reusability";;;;;;;"Basili, V., Caldiera, G., Rombach, H.D., The Goal Question Metric Approach (1994) Encyclopedia of Sof.

Whereas building systems was the predominant activity, more recently the focus has shifted toward composing systems from open-source, commercial and proprietary components and to only build the functionality that truly is competitively differentiating. In addition, the way software is developed has changed as well, especially focusing on short development cycles and frequent, or even continuous, deployment. Because of these requirements, often teams are organized around features, rather than components, and can change all components in the system, including their interfaces. A third trend is the increasing adoption of software ecosystems, where significant development of functionality relevant for customers occurs outside the platform organization. Obviously, however, the quality attributes that are necessary for system success remain important as well as the ability to easily incorporate new requirements in the system in a cost effective fashion. Because of the above, the role of software architecture and in particular the software architects is more important in this new world, but there is significant evolution in the implementation of the role. The paper starts by characterizing the new approach to software engineering and the role of compositionality. It then explores the implications for software architecture and the role of the software architect, Finally, it defines a number of research challenges for the ECSA community to explore. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;"Compositionality; Software architecture";"Building systems; Compositionality; Cost effective; Development cycle; New approaches; Open-source; Quality attributes; Research challenges; Software architects; Software ecosystems; System success; Ecology; Software architecture";;;;;;;;"Bosch, J.; Intuit, Mountain View, CA, United States; email: Jan@JanBosch.com";;;;4th European Conference on Software Architecture, ECSA 2010;23 August 2010 through 26 August 2010;Copenhagen;82132;3029743;"3642151132; 9783642151132";;;English;Lect.

Service-oriented computing (SOC) is a means towards business-process automation and recently, many industry standards emerged to become part of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) stack. In a globalized world, organizations face new challenges for setting up and carrying out collaborations in semi-automating ecosystems for business services. A need emerges for service Hubs that not only store service offers and requests together with their issuing organizations and assigned owners, but that also allow an evaluation of trust and reputation in an anonymized electronic service marketplace. In this paper, we explore the features of a semi-automating ecosystem in which business processes are expressed as services and where Hubs are essential for bringing together service offers and requests. The presented Hub architecture is designed so that business managers benefit from an interface that borrows concepts of social-networking sites while the complex computing machinery for matching service offers and requests remains hidden from the user. The partial implementation of service-Hub components demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.;"B2B; BPM; Broker; Collaboration; Hub; Ontology; Reputation; SOC; Trust";"B2B; BPM; Broker; Collaboration; Hub; Reputation; SOC; Trust; Architecture; Distributed computer systems; Information services; Information systems; Machinery; Ontology; World Wide Web; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"(2006) Service Orientation: Winning Strategies and Best Practices, , Allen, P.

However, the definitions do not adequately capture the inter-system level software relationships. This leaves software architects either unaware of critical relationships or, to 'roll their own' based on aggregations of code-level call/use structures. This leads to critical gaps in the architectural description and communication problems within distributed development environments - as poorly understood relationships can inadvertently propagate changes and break system interoperability [2]. The solution requires a description of new system level relationships and a new systematic, repeatable technique to detect both immediate and linked system level relationships. The solution will be developed through the mining of existing software ecosystems and industry systems of software intensive systems (S3) architectures. Validation will be performed through case studies from industry collaborations.

Application of the collaborative networks paradigm, and the new generation of collaboration-support platforms and tools, can offer a promising approach to supporting active ageing, and can facilitate better use of the talents and potential of retired or retiring senior professionals. This paper introduces the results of a roadmapping initiative addressing the implementation of a new vision for extending professional active life. To support this vision, a strategic research plan for the development of a new digital ecosystem, covering the social, organizational, and technological perspectives, is proposed. A large number of stakeholders coming from different backgrounds have contributed to the design and validation of this roadmap.;"Active ageing; Collaborative networks; Roadmap";"Collaborative network; Digital ecosystem; Physical health; Professional life; Roadmap; Roadmapping; Social interactions; Strategic research; Technological perspective; Economic and social effects; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Health";;;;;;;"(2007) The Future of Retirement - The New Old Age, , www.hsbc.com/1/PA_1_1_S5/content/assets/retirement/ gender_perspective_eurasia_africa_1.pdf, May; (2002) Active Aging: A Policy Framework, , WHO, WHO/NMH/NPH/02.8, World Health Organisation report; Wilson, P., Johnson, K., Buller, W., (2008) Ageing Well in a Connected World: Smarter Care, Smarter Participation, , CISCO Internet Business Solutions Group, Dec; Camarinha-Matos, L.M., Afsarmanesh, H., Collaborative mechanisms for a new perspective on active ageing Proceedings of DEST 2009 - 3rd IEEE Int.

Identity and access management in such a setting is twofold and should provide access to federated medical data spread across multiple sites to medical professionals while at the same time protect the privacy of the patients - whose medical data is used for research purposes - by pseudonymization. This paper discusses the identity and access management approach developed in the @neurIST project which deals with the study and treatment of cerebral aneurysms. @neurIST aims at developing a decision support system and a research infrastructure that unites multiple medical institutions and service providers offering technical solutions based on the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm for treating and researching diseases. The system developed within @neurIST adopts claim-based security models to implement an efficient identity and access management for data access in the @neurIST service ecosystem and pseudonymization technologies to protect the patients' privacy. © Springer-Verlag 2010.;"Claim-based security; Distributed access control; Grid computing; Identity management; Medical research; Service oriented architecture; Web services";"Cerebral Aneurysms; Claim-based security; Data access; Identity and access managements; Identity management; Medical data; Medical institutions; Medical professionals; Medical research; Pseudonymization; Research infrastructure; Security model; Service ecosystems; Service provider; Technical solutions; Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Data privacy; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Grid computing; Information services; Management; Medical computing; Research; Security systems; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Societies and institutions; Web services; Access control";;;;;IST-027703, EC, European Commission;This work was generated in the framework of the @neurIST Integrated Project, which is co-financed by the European Commission through the contract No. IST-027703.;"A taxonomy of secondary uses and re-uses of healthcare data (2007) Invitational Conf. on Secondary Use of Health Data, , http://www.amia.org/inside/initiatives/healthdata/2007/index.asp/, American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), Available online at:; Arbona, A., Benkner, S., Engelbrecht, G., Fingberg, J., Hofmann, M., Kumpf, K., Lonsdale, G., Woehrer, A., A service-oriented grid infrastructure for biomedical data and compute services (2007) IEEE Transactions NanoBioscience, 6 (2), pp. 136-141; (2005), http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/security/, Cantor, S., Kemp, J., Philpott, R., Maler, E.

In order to manage such consequences, we need dedicated actions for resilience. In such a scenario, the process of adaptation to climate change plays an important part. This is achieved by first identifying the various events of risks, assessing the level of their impacts, and then developing policies by which they can be mitigated. For effective adaptation, the events of global warming should be identified and assessed on a regional scale. In this paper, we propose a digital information ecosystem architecture for climate change adaptability. The proposed architecture will capture the different regional factors of global warming which can then be linked together to produce effective macro adaptation policies. ©2009 IEEE.;"Climate change; Global warming; Macro impacts; Micro impacts; Multi-system and adaptation";"Digital information; Planet earth; Proposed architectures; Regional climate changes; Regional scale; Climatology; Earth (planet); Global warming; Image quality; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Nature, (2003) Fossil fuels: The evolution of human culture; Jones, P.D., Moberg, A., Hemispheric and large-scale surface air temperature variations: An extensive revision and an update to 2001 (2003) Journal of Climate, 16, pp. 206-223; Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., Noguer, M., Van Der Linden, P.J., Xioaosu, D., Summary for Policymakers: Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis (2001) Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Greenhouse Gas Division Environment Canada, National Inventory Report 1990-2005: Greenhouse Gas Sources and Sinks in Canada, Ottawa 2007; (2001) Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC; (2005) The Economics of Climate Change, 1. , Economic Affairs Committee, quot;; (2007) Summary for Policymakers, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Summary for Policymakers.

Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598, United States";Web-delivered service is an emerging approach for IT service to reduce IT service cost and improve delivery efficiency by leveraging the partnership and web technology. This paper proposes a three-tier analytical framework of web-delivered service to improve business deign based on the centralised information from the platform. At business model design tier, a role-based service ecosystem modelling method is presented to contain the duplication and evolvement of participants' functionalities within the same model. Through the model, we can analyse the impact of business model on the business performance. At service analytics tier, we summarise the available data and categorise the operational analysis by roles. At self-transform tier, several potential functionalities are listed to help end client to do business transformation by themselves. Based on such framework, a case study in mini-ERP services is presented to illustrate how the analytics technology can help in business design of web-delivered service.

Major implications are (1) software vendors have trouble distinguishing the specific software ecosystems in which they are active and (2) they have trouble using these ecosystems to their strategic advantage. In this paper we present and formalize a standards-setting approach to software product and software supply network modeling. Applying this approach enables software vendors to communicate about relationships in the software supply network, theorize about weak spots/links in their business model and anticipate upcoming changes in the software ecosystem. © 2009 ACM.;"Product deployment context; Software ecosystem modeling; Software supply network";"Business models; Ecosystem modeling; Formal modeling; Product deployment; Software products; Software vendors; Strategic advantages; Supply networks; Computer software; Technical presentations; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Bala Iyer, N.V., Lee, C.-H., Managing in a ""small world ecosystem"": Lessons from the software sector (2006) Harvard Business Review, 5. , May; Bannerman, P., Zhu, L., (2009) Standardization As A Business Ecosystem Enabler, pp. 298-303; Brinkkemper, S., (1990) Formalization of Information Systems Modelling, , PhD thesis; Brinkkemper, S., Van Soest, I., Jansen, S., (2007) Modeling of Product Software Businesses: Investigation into Industry Product and Channel Typologies, pp. 1-19; Farbey, B., Finkelstein, A., Software acquisition: A business strategy analysis (2001) Proceedings.

Ecosystems are thought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve complex, dynamic problems. However, the computing technologies that contribute to these properties have not been made explicit in digital ecosystems research. Here, we discuss how different computing technologies can contribute to providing the necessary self-organising features, including Multi-Agent Systems (MASs), Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs), and distributed evolutionary computing (DEC). The potential for exploiting these properties in digital ecosystems is considered, suggesting how several key features of biological ecosystems can be exploited in Digital Ecosystems, and discussing how mimicking these features may assist in developing robust, scalable self-organising architectures. An example architecture, the Digital Ecosystem, is considered in detail. The Digital Ecosystem is then measured experimentally through simulations, considering the self-organised diversity of its evolving agent populations relative to the user request behaviour.

According to Papazoglou et al., one challenge is to develop services in a dynamic environment with high uncertainties, and in collaboration with other companies. The Integrated Service Engineering (ISE) Workbench is a step in this direction in that it supports a model-driven approach and different stakeholders. This paper briefly introduces the ISE Framework, presents the ISE Workbench and its functionality, and proposes a demonstration of a conducted case study in the IT outsourcing domain.

The effects are assessed via a resource allocation algorithm for load balancing, based on the observed behaviour of foraging honeybees. It is implemented at the application layer of a simulated server farm type system and its impact is investigated across this layer and the resource layer through the analyses of the digital ecosystems arising and the associated partitioning into task specific communities of server functions. The specific topological self-organisation of scale-free connectivity is shown to ensue in a remote layer from the initially artificially engineered honeybee foraging behaviour for self-organisation. © 2009 IEEE.;;"Application layers; Digital ecosystem; Global services; Load-Balancing; Resource allocation algorithms; Scale-free; Self-organisation; Server farms; Server function; Type systems; Computer crime; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA)";;;;;;;"Ruggaber, R., Internet of Services SAP Research Vision (2007) Proceeding of the 16th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises, 2007 (WETICE, p. 3; Briscoe, G., De Wilde, P., Digital Ecosystems: Optimisation by a Distributed Intelligence (2008) Proceedings of the 2nd, , IEEE International Conference on Digital Ecosystems and Technologies, Phitsanulok, Thailand; Sterritt, R., Autonomic Computing (2005) Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering, 1 (1), pp. 79-88; M.

They also need to be able to keep in pace with their heterogeneous internal legacy systems. In addition, they should not have to modify their infrastructure or applications for fast and short collaboration implying information and knowledge interchange with new partners of their ecosystem. Current solutions are less and less adapted to face increasing needs and complexity. As proposing a new disruptive approach and technologies is inappropriate, this paper presents how to build enterprise application interoperability framework based on simultaneous and coherent usage of eBusiness standards used by a given ecosystem, combining usage of the different relevant frameworks supporting these standards. The goal is achievement of ""pragmatic"" interoperability. For the proposed approach, we consider simultaneous usage of Model Driven Engineering, Enterprise Modeling and Service Oriented Architecture. We also promote systematic usage of commodities on the WEB based on open and governed standards. Doing so, we have to solve issues related to semantic preservation, all along the lifecycle of the artifacts and infrastructures required to define and exploit an application. We introduce for that the concept of Extended Hypermodels and associated grounds.

Autonomic computing is an effective set of technologies, models, architecture patterns, standards, and processes to cope with and reign in the management complexity of dynamic computing systems using feedback control, adaptation, and self-management. At the core of an autonomic system are control loops which sense their environment, model their behavior in that environment, and take action to change the environment or their own behavior. Computer science researchers often approach the design of such highly dynamical systems from a software architecture perspective whereas engineering researchers start with a feedback control perspective. In this article, we argue that both design perspectives are needed and necessary for autonomic system design. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.;"Autonomic computing; Autonomic computing reference architecture; Autonomic element; Autonomic patterns; Continuous evolution; Feedback loops; Self-managing systems; Selfadaptive systems; Software complexity management; Software ecosystems";"Autonomic computing; Autonomic computing reference architecture; Autonomic element; Autonomic patterns; Continuous evolution; Feedback loops; Self-managing systems; Selfadaptive systems; Software complexity management; Software ecosystems; Computer software; Design; Dynamical systems; Ecosystems; Feedback control; Large scale systems; Software architecture; Feedback";;;;;;;"Astrom, K.J., Wittenmark, B., (1995) Adaptive Control, , 2nd edn.

The user will be challenged to survive in a wild and wide service ecosystem. In this paper we present the Matcher network functionality that aims to provide guidance to the user in such a rich but complex service ecosystem. The Matcher is a framework not only to allow the user and service providers to produce semantically enabled (user, service and content) profiles and match these profiles, but also to obtain useful results using simple tags and semantically enabled tags - statements. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.;"IMS; Semantic web; Service discovery; SOA; WEB 2.0; XDM";"Information services; Information theory; Insulating materials; Multimedia services; Multimedia systems; Network architecture; Semantic Web; Semantics; Telecommunication equipment; IMS; Service discovery; SOA; WEB 2.0; XDM; Distributed computer systems";;;;;;;"http://www.google.com; Open mobile alliance, , http://www.openmobilealliance.org; Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, T., Lassila, O., (2001) The semantic web, , Scientific American; Calvanese, D., De Giacomo, G., Lembo, D., Lenzerini, M., Rosati, R., Dl-lite: Tractable description logics for ontologies (2005) Proceedings, The Twentieth National Conference on AI and the Seventeenth Innovative Applications of AI Conference, pp. 602-607. , Veloso, M.M, Kambhampati, S, eds, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, pp, MIT Press, Cambridge; Choi, N., Song, I.-Y., Han, H., A survey on ontology mapping (2004) Recommendation, W3C. , http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref, February; Donini, F.M., Lenzerini, M., Nardi, D., Schaerf, A., Deduction in concept languages: From subsumption to instance checking (1994) Journal of Logic and Computation, 4 (4), pp. 423-452; N.W.: The extensible markup language(xml)configuration access protocol(xcap).

This growing adoption increased the demands for new ways of using Web service technology. Users start re-combining and mediating other providers' services in ways that have not been anticipated by their original provider. Within organisations and cross-organisational communities, discoverable services are organised in repositories providing convenient access to adaptable end-to-end business processes. This idea is captured in the term Service Ecosystem. This paper addresses the question of how quality management can be performed in such service ecosystems. Service quality management is a key challenge when services are composed of a dynamic set of heterogeneous sub-services from different service providers. This paper contributes to this important area by developing a reference model of quality management in service ecosystems. We illustrate the application of the reference model in an exploratory case study. With this case study, we show how the reference model helps to derive requirements for the implementation and support of quality management in an exemplary service ecosystem in public administration. © Springer-Verlag 2008.;"Quality management; Quality of service; Reference model; Requirements engineering; Service ecosystem; Service level management; Web service";;;;;;"Queensland Government; LP0669244, ARC, Australian Research Council; 10MQ07024, BMWi, Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie";Acknowledgments Parts of this research have been funded by a research project within the Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Schema (grant code LP0669244) including financial support from SAP and the Queensland Government.

To narrow the semantic gap of Telecommunications Network and Internet in the service layer, we introduce the vision of User Centric Intelligent Service Environment (UCISE). The ubiquitous service ecosystem and the semantic service integration architecture of telecommunications network and Internet are proposed. To provide the semantic Telecommunications Network Capability Services (TNCS), we present a semantic description approach for TNCS by using the profile hierarchy of OWL-S. Then based on this approach, we demonstrate the cheapest click-to-call application case. In this way, the ontology-based accurate discovery, matching for telecommunication network capability services can be supported. This will facilitate the semantic convergence of telecommunications network and Internet in the service layer. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.;"Ontology; OWL-S d; Semantic Parlay; Semantic Parlay X; Semantic Telecommunication Network Capability Service; Semantic Web Service; Service-Oriented Architecture; Telecommunication Service Domain Ontology; User Centric Service";"Information services; Information theory; Internet; Metropolitan area networks; Ontology; Semantic Web; Semantics; Telecommunication; Telecommunication networks; Telecommunication systems; Telecommunication traffic; Ubiquitous computing; User interfaces; Web services; World Wide Web; OWL-S d; Semantic Parlay; Semantic Parlay X; Semantic Telecommunication Network Capability Service; Semantic Web Service; Service-Oriented Architecture; User Centric Service; Telecommunication services";;;;;;;"Zahariadis, T., Trends in the Path to 4G (2003) IEEE Communications Engineer, 1, pp. 12-15; Benali, O., A Framework for an Evolutionary Path toward 4G by Means of Cooperation of Networks (2004) IEEE Communications Magazine, 42, pp. 82-89; Qiao, X.Q., Li, X.F., Liang, S.Q., Reference Model of Future Ubiquitous Convergent Network and Context-Aware Telecommunication Service Platform (2006) The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications, 13, pp. 50-56; Parlay Group, Parlay API 4.0, http://www.parlay.org; , 10. , http://www.parlay.org/en/specifications/pxws.asp; http://www.w3.org/Submission/2004/07, OWL-S; Web Ontology Language (OWL), , http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL; Hong, S.J., Han, S.Y., Choi, B., Kim, Y.J., Ahn, C.H., The semantic PARLAY for 4G network (2005) 2nd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems, pp. 15-17; Hong, S., Han, S., Song, K.-H.: The extended PARLAY X for an adaptive context-aware personalized service in a ubiquitous computing environment.

The design of such tools should consider learners' access to technology in these different contexts. This paper presents a Digital Learning Ecosystem Model, which similarly to nature ecosystems consists of species, populations and communities interacting with each other and with the environment. The proposed model supports the analysis of four important learning tools' aspects: authoring, collaboration, immersion and mobility. The model was applied to recently developed learning tools and pointed out their characteristics and how they can be extended.;"Digital ecosystem; Learning tools";"Digital ecosystem; Digital media; Digital technologies; Digital-learning; Ecosystem model; Learning tool; Support learning; Digital storage; Education; Standby power systems; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Abreu, S., (2008) O Uso das Provas Operatórias Para Diagnóstico dos Problemas da Aprendizagem, , http://www.unifai.edu.br/internet_noticia.asp?cod_conteudo=2722&area= 1627, In:, Acessed on Feb/; Chang, V., Guetl, C., E-learning ecosystem (ELES) - A holistic approach for the development of more effective learning environment for small-and- medium sized enterprises (SMEs) (2007) Proc.

Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598, United States";Web-delivered service is an emerging approach for IT service by leveraging the partnership and web technology to reduce IT service cost and improve delivery efficiency. To make it more effective, business design is also very important besides technology innovation. This paper proposes a three-tier analytical framework to improve business deign based on the centralized information from the platform. At business model design tier, a role-based service ecosystem modeling method is presented to contain the duplication and evolvement of participants' functionalities within the same model. Through the model, we can analyze the impact of business model on the business performance. At service analytics tier, we summarize the available data and categorize the operational analysis by roles. At self-transform tier, several potential functionalities are listed to help end client to do business transformation by themselves. Based on such framework, a case study in mini-ERP services is presented to illustrate how the analytics technology can help in business design of web-delivered service. ©2008 IEEE.;"Business model; Service ecosystem; Web-delivered service";"Ecology; Information technology; Innovation; Business designs; Business model; Business performances; Business transformations; Case studies; It services; Modeling methods; Operational analysis; Potential functionalities; Service ecosystem; Technology innovations; WEB technologies; Web-delivered service; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"Guo, C.J., Sun, W., Huang, Y., Wang, Z.H., Gao, B., A Framework for Native Multi-Tenancy Application Development and Management (2007) 4th IEEE International Conference on Enterprise Computing, ECommerce, and E-Services, 2007.

A resource allocation algorithm is implemented at the application (business services) layer and its impact is investigated across this layer and the resource (business function) layer through the analysis of the service (server) compositions (digital ecosystem) arising and its associated partitioning into task specific teams (communities). Beneficial self-organisation is shown to ensue in a remote layer from the initially instigated engineered self-organisation. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.;;"Cybernetics; Distributed computer systems; Dynamics; Information services; Planning; Resource allocation; Software architecture; Business functions; Business services; Cross layers; Digital ecosystems; Internet of Services; Resource allocation algorithms; Service-oriented architectures; Technical presentations";;;;;;;"Mamei, M., Menezes, R., Tolksdorf, R., Zambonelli, F., Case Studies for Self-Organization in Computer Science (2006) J.

E-Learning ecosystems and CSCW systems should aim to provide as many functionalities as needed from users in order to act as a centralized interface for their collaborative learning and daily work. Since more and more functionalities are made available as webservices, these can be adapted into a collaborative system. In contemporary collaborative systems, however, such an adaption is often a challenge. Service oriented architectures (SOAs) facilitate the adaption and linking of webservices and build an ideal platform for new e-Learning ecosystems and CSCW systems. This paper presents the key aspects of turning the established CSCW system open-sTeam into a service oriented architecture (SOA). Our new flexible Wasabi framework, based on EJB 3 and JBoss, results in the next level of e-Learning ecosystems and CSCW enterprise architectures which is highly adaptable due to the support of webservices. © 2008 IEEE.;;"Digital arithmetic; E-learning; Ecology; Ecosystems; Education; Groupware; Information services; Internet; Interoperability; Multimedia systems; Software architecture; Collaborative learnings; Collaborative systems; Collaborative workings; Cscw systems; E - learnings; Enterprise architectures; Recent developments; Service-oriented architectures; Web 2.0; WebServices; Working systems; Distributed computer systems";;;;;;;"Benford, S., Bowers, J., Fahlen, L., Greenhalgh, C., Managing mutual awareness in collaborative virtual environments (1994) Virtual Reality Software and Technology (Proceedings of VRST'94, August 23-26, 1994, Singapore), pp. 223-236. , Singapore; Bernstein, P., Repositories and object oriented databases (1998) ACM SIGMOD Record, 27 (1), pp. 88-96; Bopp, T., Hinn, R., Hampel, T., A service-oriented infrastructure for collaborative learning in virtual knowledge spaces (2006) Education for the 21st Century, pp. 35-44; Brebner, P., Gosper, J., J2ee infrastructure scalability and throughput estimation (2003) SIGMETRICS Perform.

(KOM), Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany";One major challenge for service-oriented workflows in digital ecosystems is capacity planning for cross-organizational Web service workflows in order to avoid performance degradation. In order to analyze the execution capacity of Web service workflows and to plan the workflow control, queuing theory can be used to describe the average performance behavior of a workflow. By addressing capacity planning of Web service workflows, resource usage becomes more and more important. Capacity planning and performance measurement are crucial to ensure that the workflow execution remains feasible and SLA violations due to overload are avoided. Thus, this paper presents a capacity planning approach for Web service workflows based on queuing theory to support capacity planning decisions.

Services originate in legacy applications of organizations, and are developed and operated typically in heterogeneous environments. Service-oriented architecture (SOA), supported by a complex stack of Web services standards, addresses ways in which software components of diverse applications can be homogeneously interacted with and composed. Thus, SOA provides a crucial mechanism for making services accessible to ubiquitous computing applications. In this chapter, we shed light on what SOA entails, based on Web services interfaces and messaging, and service composition through single-party process orchestration and multiparty choreography languages. For the latter, concrete patterns are used to describe the capabilities of prospective standards. Ways in which SOA needs be extended to allow wider and more flexible service trading, typified in current developments through service marketplaces, are then discussed. Such extensions, we argue, converge with directions in ubiquitous computing through so-called ubiquitous service networks and service ecosystems. © 2008, IGI Global.;;;;;;;;;"Alonso, G., Casati, F., Kuno, H., Machiraju, V., (2004) Web Services: Concepts, Architectures and Applications, , Springer-Verlag; Barros, A.P., Dumas, M., ter Hofstede, A.H.M., Service interaction patterns: Towards a reference framework for service-based business process interconnection (2005) Proceedings of the Third International Conference On Business Process Management 2005 (BPM'2005), , Nancy, Francex; Barros, A.P., Dumas, M., The rise of web service ecosystems (2006) IEEE it Professional Magazine, 8 (5), pp. 31-37; Barros, A.P., Bruza, P., Augmenting web services discovery with cognitive semantics and abduction, SAP Research Technical Report Journal of Web Semantics, , (in press); Benatallah, B., Casati, F., Grigori, D., Motahari-Nezhad, H., Toumani, F., Developing adapters for web services integration (2005) Proceedings of the International Conference On Advanced Information Systems Engineering 2005 (CAiSE'2005), pp. 415-429. , Porto, Portugal, Springer-Verlag; Birrel, A.D., Nelson, B.J., Implementing remote procedure calls (1984) ACM Transactions On Computer Systems (TOCS), 2 (1), pp. 39-59; Campman, M., (2004) Service Delivery Platforms and Telecom Web Services, , http://www.morianagroup.com/graphics/reports/The%20Moriana%20Group%20SDP%20Operator%20Guide%20to%20SDP%20June%202004.pdf, (Tech.

The Internet and the Web have extended traditional business networks by allowing also a web of different digital resources to work together to create value. Additionally, the increasing adoption of service-oriented architectures has allowed the creation of service ecosystems in which Web services are exposed and connected. The TEXO project proposes to combine these two trends to create what is called Future Business Value Networks which enable IT-supported value networks via service ecosystems. This paper addresses the main challenging issues that need to be explored to provide an integrated technical infrastructure to support this emerging new type of business networks.;"Business models; Business value networks; E-service; Service; Service engineering; Web service";"Business models; Business value networks; E-service; Service; Service engineering; Business networks; Business value; Digital resources; E-services; Service ecosystems; Technical infrastructure; Technical resources; Value network; Information services; Management information systems; Models; Systems analysis; Web services; World Wide Web; Human computer interaction; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Information systems; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Information systems; Metropolitan area networks";;;;;;;"Baida, Z., Gordijn, J., Omelayenko, B., A Shared Service Terminology for Online Service Provisioning (2004) The 6th International Conference on Electronic Commerce (ICEC'04), pp. 1-10. , Delft, The Netherlands; Fielding, R.T., (2000) Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures, , Ph.D. Thesis, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California; Hull, R., Benedikt, M., Christophides, V. and Su, J., 2003.

The framework includes an ecosystem-modeling component, a simulation component, and a service-analysis component, and integrates methods from value network modeling, game theory analysis, and multiagent systems. A role-based paradigm is introduced for characterizing ecosystem entities in order to easily allow for the evolution of the ecosystem and duplicated functionality for entities. We show how the framework can be used to provide insight into value distribution among the entities and evaluation of business model performance under different scenarios. The methods are illustrated using a case study of a retail business-to-business service ecosystem.

Different service ecosystems based on different service models have been constructed for research, practical usage or some other purposes. The problem of how to construct a service ecosystem, that is, the constructing methodology problem, has arisen as an urgent research point in Service Science area. This paper proposes a specific constructing methodology which is concluded from actual developing experience of service ecosystems. Each step of this methodology is introduced in detail in this paper.

On building a SOA for application systems, more and more research has been focused on service composition, in which workflow and simulation techniques have shown great potential. Simulation of services' interaction is important since the services ecosystem is dynamic and in continuous evolution. However, there is a lack in the research of services' simulation, especially models, methods and systems to support the simulation of interaction behavior of composite services. In this paper, an enhanced workflow simulation method with the support of interactive events mechanism is proposed to fulfill this requirement. At build time, we introduce an event sub-model in the workflow meta-model, and our simulation engine supports the event-based interaction pattern at run time. With an example simulated in the prototype system developed according to our method, the advantages of our method in model verification and QoS evaluation for service compositions are also highlighted.

The Blue Gene/P system is designed to scale to at least 262,144 quad-processor nodes, with a peak performance of 3.56 petaflops. More significantly, the Blue Gene/P system enables this unprecedented scaling via architectural and design choices that maximize performance per watt, performance per square foot, and mean time between failures. This paper describes our vision of this petascale system, that is, a system capable of delivering more than a quadrillion (1015) floating-point operations per second. We also provide an overview of the system architecture, packaging, system software, and initial benchmark results. © Copyright 2008 by International Business Machines Corporation.;;"Parallel processing systems; Program processors; Software architecture; Blue Gene/P system; Petascale system; Supercomputers";;;;;;;"Blue Gene, IBM J.

""noon"" is interpreted as ""the highest, brightest, or finest point or part"" or ""the highest point"". This paper introduces some basic features of Web X.o that expands the current Web to the ""highest and brightest"" point. The key concept of Services HyperChain in the Web eXpandoo framework is introduced to provide an enabling technology architecture that supports the future Web, which coordinates multimedia presentations, human interactions, business processes, computing resources, and business applications in a uniform fashion. Today's Web 2.0 technologies are mainly dealing with the presentation and community-based interaction aspects in the Web X.o framework. The boundary among Web, desktop applications, and backend resources are removed by creating Services HyperChain in the Web eXpandoo framework. The IEEE Body of Knowledge on Services Computing system is used as a prototype to illustrate how the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Web 2.0 technologies are used to to realize the Services HyperChain with unified services resource and services ecosystem enablement architecture of Web X.o. © 2007 IEEE.";"Services computing; Services HyperChain; SOA; Web 2.0; Web eXpandoo; Web X.o";"(OTDR) technology; Body of knowledge (BOK); Business applications; Business processes (BP); case studies; Computing resources; Computing systems; Desktop applications; human interactions; international conferences; Multimedia presentation (MMP); Service oriented architecture (SOA); Web 2.0; Computer systems; Flow interactions; Information services; Multimedia services; Multimedia systems; Web services; World Wide Web; Technology";;;;;;;"Zhang, L.J., Zhang, J., Cai, H., (2007) Services Computing, , Springer Verlag; Erl, T., (2005) Service-Oriented Architecture: A field guide to integrating XML and Web services, , Prentice Hall; Erl, T., (2004) Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): Concepts, technology, and design, , Prentice Hall; Linden, G., Smith, B., York, J., Amazon, com recommendations: Item-to-item collaborative filtering (2003) IEEE Internet Computing, 7, pp. 76-80; Kumar, K.G., Lipscomb, J.S., Ramchandra, A., Chang, S.S.P., Gaddy, W.L., Leung, R.H., Wood, S., Menon, J.P., The HotMedia architecture: Progressive and interactive rich media for the Internet (2001) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 3, pp. 253-267; Castronova, E., Virtual Worlds: A First-Hand Account of Market and Society on the Cyberian Frontier (2001) The Gruter Institute Working Papers on Law, Economics, and Evolutionary Biology, 2; Second Life, , http://www.secondlife.com; Noon, http://webster.com/dictionary/noon; Zhang, L.J., Jeckle, M., (2003) The next big thing: Web services collaboration, 2853, pp. 1-10; http://www.kpmg.com/xbrl/xlink2.pdf,Understanding XBRL: A Technical Guide to Working with XBRL 2.0 and XLink; Sayah, J.Y., Zhang, L.J., On-demand business collaboration enablement with web services (2005) Decision Support Systems, 40 (1), pp. 107-127; IEEE Body of Knowledge on Services Computing, , http://www.servicescomputing.tv/rss/view/UserLogin.php; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2,Web 2.0; http://tab.computer.org/tcsc, IEEE Services Computing";"Zhang, L.-J.; IBM T.J.

Locks are typically used in transactional models for assurance of data consistency and integrity in a concurrent environment. In addition, recovery management is used to preserve atomicity and durability in transaction models. Unfortunately, conventional lock mechanisms severely (and intentionally) limit concurrency in a transactional environment. Such lock mechanisms also limit recovery capabilities. Finally, existing recovery mechanisms themselves afford a considerable overhead to concurrency. This paper describes a new transaction model that supports release of early results inside and outside of a transaction, decreasing the severe limitations of conventional lock mechanisms, yet still warranties consistency and recoverability of released resources (results). This is achieved through use of a more flexible locking mechanism and by using two types of consistency graph. This provides an integrated solution for transaction management, recovery management and concurrency control. We argue that these are necessary features for management of long-term transactions within ""digital ecosystems"" of small to medium enterprises. © 2007 The authors and IOS Press.

However, proposed service-oriented architectures are usually based on centralised components, such as service registries or service brokers, that introduce reliability, management, and performance issues. In this paper, we present a fully decentralised service-oriented architecture built on top of a self-organising peer-to-peer infrastructure. This architecture is especially designed to support digital ecosystems due to its low deployment and maintenance cost and inherently decentralised nature. © 2007 IEEE.;;"Costs; Ecosystems; Electronic document exchange; Industrial management; Telecommunication services; Digital ecosystem; Service oriented architectures; Service oriented computing; Distributed computer systems";;;;;;;"Huhns, M.N., Singh, M.P., Service-oriented computing: Key concepts and principles (2005) IEEE Internet Comput, 9 (1), pp. 75-81. , January; Papazoglou, M.P., Service-oriented computing: Concepts, characteristics and directions (2003) Proc. of the 4th Int.

Ecosystems are thought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve complex, dynamic problems. However, the biological processes that contribute to these properties have not been made explicit in digital ecosystem research. Here, we discuss how biological properties contribute to the self-organising features of natural ecosystems. These properties include populations of evolving agents, a complex dynamic environment, and spatial distributions which generate local interactions. The potential for exploiting these properties in artificial systems is then considered. An example architecture, the Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE), is considered in detail. Simulation results imply that the DBE performs better at large scales than a comparable service-oriented architecture. These results suggest that incorporating ideas from theoretical ecology can contribute to useful selforganising properties in digital ecosystems. © 2007 IEEE.;"Complexity; Ecosystem; Evolution";"Biology; Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Industrial management; Problem solving; Robust control; Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE); Digital ecosystems; Digital control systems";;;;;;;"Miller, S.K., Aspect-oriented programming takes aim at software complexity (2001) Technologuy; Tschudin, C., Fraglets - a metabolistic execution model for communication protocol (2003) 2nd Annual Symposium on Autonomous Intelligent Networks and Systems; About the digital ecosystem, , http://www.ximbiotix.com/desktop/the-digital-ecosystem/about-the-digital - ecosystem.cfm, XIMBIOTIX, Online, Available; H.

The author will highlight such differences and describe the features of a new architectural style: called Ecosystem Oriented Architecture (EOA). The paper will explore the fact that a DES oriented architecture is not a ""sort of SOA"", it's not just a ""bigger SOA"".

Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are Suited to digital ecosystems for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) because they allow each service client machine to act also as a service provider. There is no large enterprise that: acts as a, central hub in the network of business relationships. SMEs organize themselves in complex web of dynamic inter-relationships within the digital ecosystem. Most present P2P system had been designed with a fixed infrastructure in mind rather than a wireless or mobile infrastructure. However, mobile wireless smart-phones are increasingly being used as business tools. This paper proposes an intelligent agent mediated peer-to-peer serviceoriented architecture (SOA) that could be used to address the dynamic requirements of a mobile and fixed infrastructure and hence provide a seamless service environment of for SME, digital business ecosystems. © 2007 IEEE.;"Agent; Mobile services; P2P";"Intelligent agents; Mobile agents; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multi agent systems; Network architecture; Web services; Mobile services; Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems; Service provider; Small and medium enterprises (SME); Distributed computer systems";;;;;;;"Shen, Z., Miao, C.Y., Gay, R., Tao, X., Goal Oriented Modeling far Intelligent Software Agents (2004) Proceedings of 2004 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT04); Kosko B.

This concern is crucial for e-commerce sites and mission-critical business applications. SOA modelling is used to implement the concept of Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE). In computing environment of DBE a chain of components link business applications together, and the strength of this chain, in terms of reliability and performance, will determine the success or failure of the business. One way to make the chain stronger is to increase the reliability of all components involved, especially the critical components of the chain. In this paper, we address the reliability issue of Digital Ecosystem's transactions. The major contribution of this research is to propose a framework for reliable transactions in DE, via the analysis of the reliability for web services computing. © 2007 IEEE.;"Businesses; Digital ecosystems; Reliability; Service oriented architecture";"Industrial management; Network architecture; Product design; Reliability analysis; Web services; Digital ecosystems; Service oriented architecture; Web services computing; Administrative data processing";;;;;;;"Abdulkarim Erradi, P.M., A Broker-based Approach for Improving Web Services Reliability (2005) IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS'05), , Orlando, FL, USA; Adil, M., Hammadi, S.A., Liu, F., A NEW MODELLING APPROACH TO ENHANCE RELIABILITY OF TRANSACTIONAL ORIENTED WEB SERVICES (2006) The 8th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Application & Services (ii-WAS, , Yogyakarta Indonesia; al., F.

Such involvement is an important factor in projects where the R&D performers are not the exploiters. The project utilised the social capital of regional actors, and conceptualised a certain kind of SME, known as Driver SMEs. The strategy adopted has worked for this project and has provided a basis for self-sustained post-project expansion. In doing so it has created a model that could easily be adopted by other projects, both in Digital Ecosystems and beyond. © 2007 IEEE.;"DBE; Regional development; SME";"Digital control systems; Project management; Research and development management; Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE); Regional development; Small and Mediumsized Enterprises (SME); Software architecture";;;;;;;;"Rathbone, N.; Daventry House Ltd.United Kingdom; email: neil.rathbone@daventryhouse.com";;;;2007 Inaugural IEEE-IES Digital EcoSystems and Technologies Conference, DEST 2007;21 February 2007 through 23 February 2007;Cairns;70254;;"1424404703; 9781424404704";;;English;Proc.

Such service compositions define the information flows between autonomous and potentially heterogeneous services across the boundaries of independent provider organisations. The availability of individual services in such Digital Ecosystems is likely to be variable due to fluctuating usage load and resource limitations imposed by a service provider's infrastructure. This problem becomes more acute as the number of services in a composition increases. This paper presents a mediation model for improving the availability of composed services. The mediation model masks failures in a service composition by transparently selecting (and executing) an alternative composition at runtime. Service consumers use a common interface to a set of functionally equivalent service compositions while a selection mechanism identifies the most suitable (alternative) service composition. An evaluation of our implementation of the proposed mediation model demonstrates that the consumer perceived availability of value-added services can be improved significantly. © 2007 IEEE.;"Dynamic service selection; Service composition; Service-oriented architectures";"Computer architecture; Information services; Mathematical models; Web services; Digital Ecosystems; Dynamic service selection; Service composition; Service-oriented architectures; Internet";;;;;;;"Dahlem, D., Mckitterick, D., Nickel, L., Dowling, J., Biskupski, B., Meier, R., Binding-and port-agnostic service composition using a p2p soa (2005) Proceedings of the International Workshop on Dynamic Web Processes (DWP 2005), pp. 61-72. , K.

Ecosystem models of the western and central Aleutian Islands and Southeast Alaska were used to examine indices of ecosystem status generated from network analysis and incorporated into Ecopath with Ecosim. Dynamic simulations of the two ecosystems over the past 40 years were employed to examine if these indices reflect the dissimilar changes that occurred in the ecosystems. The results showed that the total systems throughput (TST) and ascendancy (A) followed the climate change signature (Pacific decadal oscillation, PDO) in both ecosystems, whereas the redundancy (R) followed the inverse trend. The different trajectories for important species such as Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), pollock (Theragra chalcograma), herring (Clupea pallasii), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) were noticeable in the Finn cycling index (FCI), entropy (H) and average mutual information (AMI): not showing large change during the time that the Stellers sea lions, herring, Pacific cod, halibut and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) increased in Southeast Alaska, but showing large declines during the decline of Steller sea lions, sharks, Atka mackerel and arrowtooth flounder in the Aleutians. On the whole, there was a change in the emergent properties of the Aleutians around 1976 that was not seen in Southeast Alaska. Conversely, the emergent properties of both systems showed a change around 1988, which indicated that both systems were unstable after 1988. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.;"Ascendancy; Ecopath with Ecosim; Ecosystem indicators; Gulf of Alaska; Network analysis; Redundancy";"aquatic community; climate change; ecosystem modeling; environmental indicator; long-term change; network analysis; population dynamics; simulation; time series; Alaska; Aleutian Islands; Gulf of Alaska; North America; Pacific Ocean; United States; Chondrichthyes; Clupea pallasi; Clupeidae; Eumetopias jubatus; Gadus macrocephalus; Hippoglossus stenolepis; Otariidae; Pleurogrammus; Pleurogrammus monopterygius; Pleuronectoidei; Pollachius; Reinhardtius stomias; Theragra";;;;;;;"Anderson, P.J., Piatt, J.F., Community reorganization in the Gulf of Alaska following ocean climate regime shift (1999) Marine Ecol Progr Series, 189, pp. 117-23; Christensen, V., Ecosystem maturity-towards quantification (1995) Ecol Model, 77, pp. 3-32; Christensen, V., Pauly, D., ECOPATH II-a software for balancing steady-state ecosystem models and calculating network characteristics (1992) Ecol Model, 61, pp. 169-85; Christensen, V., Walters, C.J., Ecopath with Ecosim: Methods, capabilities and limitations (2004) Ecol Model, 172, pp. 109-39; Christensen, V., Walters, C., Pauly, D., (2000) Ecopath with Ecosim: A User's Guide, pp. 1-131. , Vancouver, BC and Penang, Malaysia: Fisheries Centre, University of British Columbia and ICLARM; Christensen, V., Walters, C., Pauly, D., (2005) Ecopath with Ecosim: A User's Guide, 154p. , Vancouver, BC: Fisheries Centre, University of British Columbia; Finn, J.T., Measures of ecosystem structure and function derived from analysis of flows (1976) J Theor Biol, 56, pp. 363-80; Guénette, S., Model of Southeast Alaska (2005) The Steller Sea Lion Decline: Models and Data of the Northeast Pacific Fisheries Centre Research Reports, 13 (1), pp. 106-178. , Guénette S, Christensen V, Eds; Guénette, S., Heymans, S.J.J., Christensen, V., Trites, A., Ecosystem models show combined effects of fishing, predation, competition, and ocean productivity on Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in Alaska (2006) Can J Fish Aquatic Sci, 63, pp. 2495-517; Hare, S.R., Mantua, N.J., Empirical evidence for North Pacific regime shifts in 1977 and 1989 (2000) Progr Oceanogr, 47, pp. 103-45; Heymans, J.J., Comparing the Newfoundland-Southern Labrador marine ecosystem models using information theory (2003) Ecosystem Models of Newfoundland and Southeastern Labrador (2J3KLNO): Additional Information and Analyses for ""Back to the Future"", 11 (5), pp. 62-71. , Heymans JJ, Ed.

They constitute a complex ecosystem with various habitats or biotopes. These wetlands provide valuable services to the ecosystem, namely water purification, flood control, biodiversity, and sustaining of livelihoods. In order to make appropriate estimates of these services, ecosystem models are needed .The present paper shows a comparative study of these two wetlands regions across a number of distinct parameters as perceived by the inhabitants.

Through this twofold process, the local search is accelerated and will yield better local optima, because the distributed optimisation already provides a good sampling of the search space by making use of computations already performed in other peers with similar constraints. We call this new distributed optimisation architecture a Digital Ecosystem, an Ecosystem-Orientated Architecture (EOA) created by extending a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with Distributed Evolutionary Computing (DEC). The Digital Ecosystem will allow services to recombine and evolve over time, constantly seeking to improve their effectiveness for the user base. Individuals within our Digital Ecosystem will be applications (groups of services), created in response to user requests by using evolutionary optimisation to aggregate the services. These individuals will migrate through the Digital Ecosystem and adapt to find niches where they are useful in fulfilling other user requests. © 2006 IEEE.";;"Computer systems; Digital arithmetic; Distributed computer systems; Ecology; Information services; Bio-inspired; Computing systems; Digital ecosystem; Evolutionary computing; Evolutionary optimisation; Local optimum; Local search; Natural ecosystems; Optimisation; Peer-to-peer network; Search spaces; Service-Oriented Architecture; Ecosystems";;;;;;;"F.

The emergence of such a software ecosystem is analyzed through an innovation perspective. The special nature of software as an intellectual technology, thus being an intangible product as opposed to physical products, is given special emphasis. Since digital products are expensive to produce, but cheap to reproduce, it is argued on the basis of a resource-based view that this ecosystem should not solely be built on the trading of software, but also on the exchange of business knowledge. © 2006 IEEE.;;"Commerce; Computer networks; Information systems; Software engineering; Strategic planning; Web services; Innovation perspective; Service oriented architectures; Strategic network; Innovation";;;;;;;"Messerschmitt, D.G., Szyperski, C., (2003) Software Ecosystem, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Denning, P.J., The Social Life of Innovation (2004) Communications of the ACM, 47, pp. 15-19; van de Ven, A.H., Running in Packs to Develop Knowledge-Intensive Technologies (2005) MIS Quarterly, 29, pp. 365-378; A.

The convergence of Internet marketplaces and SOA is enhancing the growth of Web service ecosystems which is a logical collection of Web services whose exposure and access are subject to constraints characteristics of business service delivery. The service consumers in these ecosystems procure services through different distribution and delivery channels, outsourcing service delivery functions such as payment, authentication, and mediation to specialist intermediaries. The first beneficiaries of open procurement of web services are ventures that successfully overcame the dot-com burst. Application servers can serve as a technological analogy to Web service ecosystems where middleware functions facilitate interoperation of application components.;;"Computer architecture; Constraint theory; Electronic document identification systems; Information services; Middleware; Societies and institutions; Business services; Outsourcing services; Service-oriented architectures (SOA); Web service ecosystems; World Wide Web";;;;;;;;"Barros, A.P.; SAP Researchemail: alistair.barros@sap.com";;;;;;;;15209202;;IPMAF;;English;IT Prof;Review;;Scopus;2-s2.0-33750805802

The interactions of the four major components of engines are facilitated through the use of a hierarchical communication topology which partitions the nodes of a distributed computing system into subclusters. The hierarchical communication topology is based on an information ecosystem modeled upon and incorporating the social structure of honeybees, and thus provides mechanisms for the efficient sharing of information. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Three of them have been selected, forests, grasslands and wetlands, which produce services of value to society. Examples of the ecosystem's services are water purification, biodiversity, flood control, wind protection and food supply. In order to make appropriate estimates of these services, ecosystem models are needed to describe how these services are produced and how they are linked to the economies of the countries concerned. Such models are not currently available. Therefore, this study makes rough calculations of values by transferring results obtained in other studies to the Danube floodplains. The services subjected to valuation are provision of input resources, recreation and nutrient purification. The estimated total annual value of the existing Danube floodplains amounts to ECU 374/ha. The total annual value of the entire actual area of Danube floodplains corresponds to ECU 650 million per year. Approximately two-thirds of this value is obtained in Romania. The value of the land as a nutrient sink accounts for about one-half of the total value. It should be noted that the calculations are based on several simplified assumptions and the results must therefore be interpreted with caution. © 1995 Academic Press Ltd.;"Danube; Economic values; Floodplains; Forest; Grassland; Wetlands";"economic evaluation; environmental economics; floodplain ecosystem; modelling approach; nutrient sink; Europe, (East), Danube River; Romania";;;;;;;"(1993), Annual Report. c/o Commission of the European Communities, Brussels, Belgium; Dister, E., New concept for landscape management and flood control on the Upper Rhine (1989) Proceedings of the International Wetland Symposium: Wetlands and River Corridor Management, , 5-9 July, 1989.
